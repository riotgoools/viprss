At each stage, he compares his size with a familiar object â€” quarter, blood cell, DNA helix â€” to keep us oriented.</p>\n\n<p>Itâ€™s worth sticking around until the end of the video for an explanation of how exponential scales are always used to represent things like this and what it would look like if we used a linear scale instead. There is an <em>unbelievable amount</em> of empty space in matter.</p>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/long%20zoom\">long zoom</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/science\">science</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/video\">video</a></p>\n\n         <p>ðŸ’¬ <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/06/i-shrink-10x-every-21s-until-im-an-atom\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> â†’</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"e0285077fdc96b5c0000090ef4d38786a4f63c6c24208b847a45f3c83e2a7220","category":"default"}
