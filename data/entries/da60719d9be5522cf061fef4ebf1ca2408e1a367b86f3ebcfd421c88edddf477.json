{"title":"Looking for a Job? Looking for Employees?","link":"https://kottke.org/24/01/looking-for-a-job-looking-for-employees","date":1706546268000,"content":"\n        <p>Want to try a thing? I donâ€™t know if running a job board in the comments section of a blog is a good idea, but if you are out there looking for work, post a quick summary of what you do, what youâ€™re looking for, and a link to your resume/portfolio/LinkedIn/contact info and maybe someone here will see it and want to hire you. Likewise, if you or your company/organization has job openings, post a brief description and a link to the opening(s). Full-time, freelance, remote-only, in-person, tech, non-tech, anything goes.</p>\n\n<p><s>Since comments can only be left by <a href=\"https://kottke.org/members\">members</a>, if youâ€™re not a member and are looking for work, send me your comment via email and I will post it for you. (If you are on the hiring side, you can afford to expense the membership fee to post a job posting. ðŸ˜‰ But if youâ€™re a non-profit, email away!)</s> Update: This thread is winding down, so Iâ€™m closing listings via email.</p>\n\n<p>I donâ€™t know what counts as spammy when Iâ€™m literally asking for ppl to post links, etc. but if it happens, Iâ€™ll delete spam listings.</p>\n\n<p>Oh, and Iâ€™m happy to accept finders fees if your company hires someone from the comments here. Ok, letâ€™s see what youâ€™ve got.</p>\n\n        \n\n\n\n <p>ðŸ’¬ <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/01/looking-for-a-job-looking-for-employees\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> â†’</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"da60719d9be5522cf061fef4ebf1ca2408e1a367b86f3ebcfd421c88edddf477","category":"default"}
