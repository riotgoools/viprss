The chef, Gaggan Anand, greets diners at his 14-seat table facing the kitchen with “Welcome to my …” completing the sentence with a term, meaning a chaotic situation, that will not be appearing in The New York Times. <em>[The word is shitshow. Or clusterfuck. Or shitstorm. Any of which should be printed in The New York Times because it’s a fact relevant to a story. This <a href=\"https://kottke.org/14/03/fit-to-print\">writing around swearing</a> has gotten <a href=\"https://kottke.org/16/10/the-ny-times-and-the-truth-of-profanity\">as ridiculous</a> as these restaurants. -ed]</em></p>\n\n<p>What follows are about two dozen dishes organized in two acts (with intermission). The menu is written in emojis. Each bite is accompanied by a long story from Mr. Anand that may or may not be true. The furrowed white orb splotched with what appears to be blood, he claims, is the brain of a rat raised in a basement feedlot.</p>\n\n<p>Brains are big in other restaurants on the list. Rasmus Munk, chef of the eighth-best restaurant in the world, Alchemist, in Copenhagen, pipes a mousse of lamb brains and foie gras into a bleached lamb skull, then garnishes it with ants and roasted mealworms. Another of the 50 or so courses — the restaurant calls them “impressions” — lurks inside the cavity of a realistic, life-size model of a man’s head with the top of the cranium removed.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>I love going to restaurants and putting myself in their talented hands<sup><a href=\"#fn:1718807011\">1</a></sup> but just reading about some of these high-wire acts dressed up as restaurants leaves me cold. (thx, <a href=\"https://yhaduong.com/\">yen</a>)</p>\n\n<ol><p><li>I’m not just talking about tasting menus here… In many places, you can ask your server what their favorites are, if there are dishes that the chef is particularly proud of, or which special is 🔥🔥🔥 tonight, and order those. If you’re a regular, you can just ask the kitchen to surprise you.<a href=\"#fnref:1718807011\">↩</a></li></p></ol>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/best%20of\">best of</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/food\">food</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/lists\">lists</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Pete%20Wells\">Pete Wells</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/restaurants\">restaurants</a></p>\n\n         <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/06/are-the-worlds-50-best-restaurants-even-restaurants\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"fab7e3cd9321733e265cb4519ccef1841678e7584717ca7e0bb89d0aad1a9e03","category":"default"}
