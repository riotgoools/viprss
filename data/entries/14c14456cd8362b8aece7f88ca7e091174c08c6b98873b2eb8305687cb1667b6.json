I donâ€™t have to lie about it or hide it. It makes me happy, and it makes my life better. There are little parallels between running and drinking, though: I feel antsy, for instance, on days when I canâ€™t run (that itch!). And I backpedal on the days I plan to rest â€” Iâ€™ll just go for a quick one right now and take tomorrow off instead. And I donâ€™t understand the people â€” my friends â€” who run only once or twice a week. Why not more? Wouldnâ€™t you want to do it every day?</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Edith and I traded Insta memes this morning about <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DCAfq76yE7O/\">running</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DCM5slZREiy/\">mountain biking</a>. Iâ€™ve been mtn biking for four years now but this year was the first time it felt urgent â€” every few days, I <em>had</em> to get out on the bike. And each time I did, I wanted to ride harder and faster and better. I pushed it so hard I <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/09/black-and-blue-and-read-all-over\">almost died</a> and didnâ€™t ride for a month, during which period I wasnâ€™t feeling apprehensive about getting back on the bike, I was impatient and antsy that I couldnâ€™t. Since getting back to it, Iâ€™ve modified my approach â€” less aggressive, more life preserving â€” but the need to get out remains. I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m going to do this winter without it.</p>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/addiction\">addiction</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/biking\">biking</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/cycling\">cycling</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Edith%20Zimmerman\">Edith Zimmerman</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/running\">running</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/sports\">sports</a></p>\n\n         <p>ðŸ’¬ <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/11/might-as-well-face-it-youre-addicted-to-running\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> â†’</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"14c14456cd8362b8aece7f88ca7e091174c08c6b98873b2eb8305687cb1667b6","category":"Sites"}
