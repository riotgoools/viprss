Grand Theft Hamlet is a documentary about the effort. It’s not streaming anywhere yet, but I hope it will be soon!</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>They audition all-comers: an uproarious business in which weird randoms show up with a tendency to destroy others by using a flame-thrower or rocket-launcher for no reason at all while the production is being explained to them.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>They end up performing the play all over the city, “this is Shakespeare on a billion dollar budget,” not sticking to the amphitheater. The trailer looks great.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Grand%20Theft%20Auto\">Grand Theft Auto</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Hamlet\">Hamlet</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/movies\">movies</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Shakespeare\">Shakespeare</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/theater\">theater</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/trailers\">trailers</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/video\">video</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/video%20games\">video games</a></p>\n\n         <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/12/grand-theft-hamlet\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Aaron Cohen","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"327ac0fb857a431b71b71a1ad972164b48762a09633fda12f2edf002a40025cd","category":"Sites"}
