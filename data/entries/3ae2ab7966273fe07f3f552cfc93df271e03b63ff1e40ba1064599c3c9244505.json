Those with lower net wealth, or poorer payment histories, would be blocked from using credit cards for credit, because they would no longer be profitable to serve. They would also find it harder to get the other services of credit cards, such as rewards or payment conveniences. Keep in mind that the average borrowing rate on credit cards today is <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/24/trump-credit-card-interest-cap-election-harris.html\" target=\"_blank\">more than 20%</a>.</p>\r\n<p>Then there are the secondary consequences. If someone cannot borrow against his or her credit card, maybe payday loans will be the next option. Are they so much better? The logic of the Sanders-Trump proposal, pursued consistently, would choke off borrowing for people with high credit risk. Should the government close all the pawn shops as well? In the limiting case, there are loan sharks and other more desperate measures. Why give those businesses greater opportunities to expand?</p>\r\n<p>It is a legitimate question, of course, whether so much consumer borrowing is productive and beneficial. Many people borrow money <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://money.com/credit-scores-fall-sports-gambling/\" target=\"_blank\">to engage in</a> sports gambling, for example, a negative-sum and sometimes addictive pursuit. Yet productive uses of borrowing are legion. What if you are a recent immigrant who just got your first job, and want to buy your kids some sports equipment so they can play after school? Should the federal government be making this more difficult for you?</p>\r\n<p>The right to borrow money is inextricably linked with other liberties. Sanders, for instance, is pro-choice when it comes to abortion. So why would he support restricting a woman’s right to borrow money to finance that abortion, or to borrow money to travel across state lines? The question is all the more pressing in a post Roe v. Wade world, where the costs of obtaining an abortion <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/psrh.12280\" target=\"_blank\">have been rising</a>.</p>\r\n<p>Ultimately, freedom of choice is intertwined with the freedom not only to spend money, but also to borrow it. And since money is a general medium of exchange, there is no way to stop only the “bad uses” of borrowed money. Thus there arises a fundamental question: Who is more qualified to make the final decisions about how best to use their financial resources, US citizens or their government?</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Recommended.</p>\r\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/11/against-federal-usury-laws-for-credit-cards.html\">Against federal usury laws for credit cards</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com\">Marginal REVOLUTION</a>.</p>\r\n<img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/908358659/0/marginalrevolution\" />\r\n<div><a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/908358659/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/908358659/marginalrevolution,\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/908358659/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/x.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/908358659/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/908358659/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/11/against-federal-usury-laws-for-credit-cards.html#comments\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/comments20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/11/against-federal-usury-laws-for-credit-cards.html/feed\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/commentsrss20.png\" /></a> \r\n<div><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/11/against-federal-usury-laws-for-credit-cards.html#comments\"><h3>Comments</h3></a><ul><li><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/11/against-federal-usury-laws-for-credit-cards.html#comment-160838778\">In reply to andrew97.
