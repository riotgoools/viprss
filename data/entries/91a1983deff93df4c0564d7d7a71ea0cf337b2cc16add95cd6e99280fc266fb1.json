(AKA Prime Day)","link":"https://kottke.org/24/07/its-random-midsummer-shopping-day-again-aka-prime-day","date":1721142055000,"content":"\n        <p><img src=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/prime-day-2024.jpg\" srcset=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=500,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/prime-day-2024.jpg 500w, /cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/prime-day-2024.jpg 1200w\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1300\" height=\"363\" alt=\"Prime Day 2024\" /></p>\n\n<p>For the last few years, Amazon has spent a couple of summer days <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2Js6S3K\">putting a bunch of their most popular items on sale</a> for their Prime members. This year, Prime Day runs from July 16-17 and includes a number of things that I can personally recommend (or are currently coveting). Keep in mind that you need to be an Amazon Prime member to take advantage of these deals: <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3XLSD1C\">here’s where you sign up for Prime if you’re interested</a> (there’s a free 30-day trial).</p>\n\n<ul><li><p>I’ve said it <a href=\"https://kottke.org/23/04/customize-your-airpods-pro-for-even-better-sound\">before</a>: I love the 2nd-gen AirPods Pro and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0D1XD1ZV3/ref=nosim/0sil8\">they’re on sale today for $169 (32% off)</a>. And I don’t think I’ve ever seen a lower price <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B07PXGQC1Q/ref=nosim/0sil8\">on the 2nd-gen AirPods</a>: $69 (47% off, nice).</p></li>\n\n<p><li><p>Oooh, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0B3BVWJ6Y/ref=nosim/0sil8\">Apple’s M2 Macbook Air is down to $800</a> (20% off). I love my M1 Air but am curious about a slightly faster machine… Or maybe I should go for an even faster machine: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0CX22ZW1T/ref=nosim/0sil8\">the M3 Macbook Air is on sale for $850</a> (23% off; note the coupon).</p></li></p>\n\n<p><li><p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0CSTJML9X/ref=nosim/0sil8\">Apple Watch Series 9 is 30% off right now at $280</a>. <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0CHX7R6WJ/ref=nosim/0sil8\">Apple Watch SE is 32% off, only $170</a>.</p></li></p>\n\n<p><li><p>This Breville air fryer is <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01N5UPTZS/ref=nosim/0sil8\">on sale for 25% off ($300)</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B08SJ6L9MT/ref=nosim/0sil8\">this Philips one is only $90 (50% off)</a>. I’ve heard good things about these — should I get an air fryer? Is that an upgrade worth the counter space?</p></li></p>\n\n<p><li><p>I’m surprised <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B09TMN58KL/ref=nosim/0sil8\">the Kindle Paperwhite</a> isn’t available at a deeper discount (10% off, $135)…usually they are up to 40% off. Maybe they’ll drop the price tomorrow?</p></li></p>\n\n<p><li><p>This is cool: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B07Z13H4TP/ref=nosim/0sil8?th=1\">the AirFly Duo</a> plugs into a standard 3.5 mm audio jack (like on an airplane seatback screen) and then you can connect up to two sets of AirPods (or other Bluetooth headphones) to it. <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B07Z13H4TP/ref=nosim/0sil8?th=1\">$36, 20% off.</a> Oh, I’m getting one of these. </p></li></p>\n\n<p><li><p>One my family’s recent favorite board games, Splendor, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00IZEUFIA/ref=nosim/0sil8\">is 53% off ($21)</a>. And this technically isn’t a Prime Day deal, but I also noticed that there’s <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0BH72GXZ5/ref=nosim/0sil8\">an expansion set for Wingspan that features birds and habitats from Asia</a> ($39, 13% off).</p></li></p>\n\n<p><li><p>Booooks! <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0593321200/ref=nosim/0sil8\">Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow by Gabrielle Zevin</a> ($10, 64% off). <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0307352153/ref=nosim/0sil8\">Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can’t Stop Talking by Susan Cain</a> ($7.50, 60% off). <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0374279292/ref=nosim/0sil8\">King: A Life by Jonathan Eig</a> ($14.50, 59% off). <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0393541215/ref=nosim/0sil8\">The Wok: Recipes and Techniques by Kenji López-Alt</a> ($30, 39% off). <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0062060627/ref=nosim/0sil8\">The Song of Achilles by Madeline Miller</a> ($8, 54% off). <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1607749165/ref=nosim/0sil8\">Ottolenghi Simple by Yotam Ottolenghi</a> ($16.50, 53% off).</p></li></p>\n\n<p><li><p>I do not play pickleball but <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B07XNBTY5V/ref=nosim/0sil8\">here’s a deal on pickleball balls for up to 45% off</a>.</p></li></p>\n\n<p><li><p>The KitchenAid mixers are on sale. <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01HKATXF0/ref=nosim/0sil8\">The 3.5-quart model is 34% off ($249)</a> and is perfect for smaller kitchens with limited counter space. The 5-quart model (this is the one that I have) <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B07QHQF8ZQ/ref=nosim/0sil8\">is $349 (27% off)</a>.</p></li></p>\n\n<p><li><p>TVs are generally good Prime Day buys. Like, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0C1J4XCCL/ref=nosim/0sil8?th=1\">here’s TCL 65-Inch Q7 QLED 4K TV for $600 (25% off)</a>.</p></li></p>\n\n<p><li><p>I have this paddleboard and it’s great for the price: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B09XN2Q438/ref=nosim/0sil8?th=1\">ROC inflatable stand-up paddleboard</a> ($200, 20% off).</p></li></p>\n\n<p><li><p>I have no idea if <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0BKSPTW57/ref=nosim/0sil8\">this hand massager</a> (31% off, $69) works or is worth the bucks, but I <em>do</em> think it would be funny to sell a gom jabbar test version of this as Dune merch.</p></li></p>\n\n<p><li><p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B07VVK39F7/ref=nosim/0sil8\">This Levoit air purifier</a> is highly rated and on sale for $79 (21% off).</p></li></p>\n\n<p><li><p>I use these on the regular and they are yummy: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B019GU4J56/ref=nosim/0sil8\">Nuun Sport: Electrolyte Drink Tablets</a> ($18, 39% off).</p></li></p>\n\n<p><li><p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/160774273X/ref=nosim/0sil8\">Flour Water Salt Yeast: The Fundamentals of Artisan Bread and Pizza by Ken Forkish</a> ($20.50, 41% off).
