My current watch, which I wear all the time (except when it's charging) is a 5th generation. The new one is 10th gen. I had to upgrade because there's a Tesla watch app out now that won't run on my old watch. It's the most rational add-on for the car. A must-have, even though I wish Elon Musk didn't run Tesla. I don't see him being compatible with their product. Not sure how they go together, wish the company would divest of him or he would stay the fuck out of the US government. Really starting to wear on me. If there were a good alternative to the Tesla, I would divest of it in a minute.","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"1430f6ddb818ced52ca2b1626db6513821f82ff968e0f9f983ac1d411f90fd73","category":"Sites"}
