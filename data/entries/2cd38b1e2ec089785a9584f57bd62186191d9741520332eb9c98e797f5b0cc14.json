He’s led teams for President Obama, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and CEO of Google. He’s worked in worlds as far apart as weapons development and philanthropy. His pioneering efforts to link Silicon Valley technology and startups to Washington has made him responsible for $70 billion in technology acquisition by the Department of Defense. He’s penned many landmark reports, and he is the author of <em>Unit X: How the Pentagon and Silicon Valley are Transforming the Future of War</em>.</p>\r\n<p>Tyler and Christopher cover the ascendancy of drone warfare and how it will affect tactics both off and on the battlefield, the sobering prospect of hypersonic weapons and how they will shift the balance of power, EMP attacks, AI as the new arms race (and who’s winning), the completely different technology ecosystem of an iPhone vs. an F-35, why we shouldn’t nationalize AI labs, the problem with security clearances, why the major defense contractors lost their dynamism, how to overcome the “Valley of Death” in defense acquisition, the lack of executive authority in government, how Unit X began, the most effective type of government commission, what he’ll learn next, and more.</p></blockquote>\r\n<p>Excerpt:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Now, I never understand what I read about <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://sgp.fas.org/crs/weapons/R45811.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">hypersonic missiles</a>. I see in the media, “China has launched the world’s first nuclear-capable hypersonic, and it goes 10x the speed of sound.” And people are worried. If mutual assured destruction is already in place, what exactly is the nature of the worry? Is it just we don’t have enough response time?</p>\r\n<p><strong>KIRCHHOFF: </strong>It’s a number of things, and when you add them up, they really are quite frightening. Hypersonic weapons, because of the way they maneuver, don’t necessarily have to follow a ballistic trajectory. We have very sophisticated space-based systems that can detect the launch of a missile, particularly a nuclear missile, but right then you’re immediately calculating where it’s going to go based on its ballistic trajectory. Well, a hypersonic weapon can steer. It can turn left, it can turn right, it can dive up, it can dive down.</p>\r\n<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>But that’s distinct from hypersonic, right?</p>\r\n<p><strong>KIRCHHOFF: </strong>Well, ICBMs don’t have the same maneuverability. That’s one factor that makes hypersonic weapons different. Second is just speed. With an ICBM launch, you have 20 to 25 minutes or so. This is why the rule for a presidential nuclear decision conference is, you have to be able to get the president online with his national security advisers in, I think, five or seven minutes. The whole system is timed to defeat adversary threats. The whole continuity-of-government system is upended by the timeline of hypersonic weapons.</p>\r\n<p>Oh, by the way, there’s no way to defend against them, so forget the fact that they’re nuclear capable — if you want to take out an aircraft carrier or a service combatant, or assassinate a world leader, a hypersonic weapon is a fantastic way to do it. Watch them very carefully because more than anything else, they will shift the balance of military power in the next five years.</p>\r\n<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Do you think they shift the power to China in particular, or to larger nations, or nations willing to take big chances? At the conceptual level, what’s the nature of the shift, above and beyond whoever has them?</p>\r\n<p><strong>KIRCHHOFF: </strong>Well, right now, they’re incredibly hard to produce. Right now, they’re essentially in a research and development phase. The first nation that figures out how to make titanium just a little bit more heat resistant, to make the guidance systems just a little bit better, and enables manufacturing at scale — not just five or seven weapons that are test-fired every year, but 25 or 50 or 75 or 100 — that really would change the balance of power in a remarkable number of military scenarios.</p>\r\n<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>How much China has them now? Are you at liberty to address that? They just have one or two that are not really that useful, or they’re on the verge of having 300?</p>\r\n<p><strong>KIRCHHOFF: </strong>What’s in the media and what’s been discussed quite a bit publicly is that China has more successful R&amp;D tests of hypersonic weapons. Hypersonic weapons are <em>very</em> difficult to make fly for long periods. They tend to self-destruct at some point during flight. China has demonstrated a much fuller flight cycle of what looks to be an almost operational weapon.</p>\r\n<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Where is Russia in this space?</p>\r\n<p><strong>KIRCHHOFF: </strong>Russia is also trying. Russia is developing a panoply of Dr. Evil weapons. The latest one to emerge in public is this idea of putting a nuclear payload on a satellite that would effectively stop modern life as we know it by ending GPS and satellite communications. That’s really somebody sitting in a Dr. Evil lair, stroking their cat, coming up with ideas that are game-changing. They’ve come up with a number of other weapons that are quite striking — <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/supercavitating-torpedoes-russia-and-iran-have-them-navy-doesn%E2%80%99t-207559\" target=\"_blank\">supercavitating torpedoes</a> that could take out an entire aircraft carrier group. Advanced states are now coming up with <em>incredibly</em> potent weapons.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Intelligent and interesting throughout.  Again, I am happy to recommend Christopher’s recent book <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.amazon.com/Unit-Pentagon-Silicon-Valley-Transforming/dp/1668031388/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1TV82TLBJ52M9&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9._TPB11aHRiyYsPFGUdMYL4ez0M5rX8oG_t7IijSoigMZGlXzZe2EWwBaX0VrCIqt1ww3Qx7S_tlHq2b6oJ1aGadgmNvcuH1Inh357Cn7wTE-sM4JcQeAUiGBA0XpzTlj-AVO5JfvAl2IPKmwzJNAbg.qoMUsaUX8Vo2X7oWDPgS0vF4KmyZSaD9atU5VkHLlSs&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=christopher+kirchhoff&amp;qid=1730320582&amp;sprefix=christopher+kirch%2Caps%2C135&amp;sr=8-1\" target=\"_blank\">Unit X: How the Pentagon and Silicon Valley are Transforming the Future of War</a>, co-authored with Raj M.
