It's a case for the new Google Pixel 9 Pro. It was shipped on Sept 6, at this point that's 17 days go. It was hell to just tell Google that the case was lost. I expected at that point they'd apologize and refund the money. That was a week ago. Just got an email saying want me to return the case when it arrives. It's never going to arrive. Luckily this is a cheap product, just $38. If it had happened with the $1316 phone that would be a pretty big problem. It's amazing that a company the size and age of Google doesn't have a procedure for dealing with products that are lost (or more likely stolen) in transit. I've been through this with Amazon, they knew what to do. Anyway I have a fairly large credit with Google. I don't dare use it to purchase anything else from them, given how incompetent they are at dealing with fairly common customer problems.","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"4f841982baeb73df4082056072e38b2fbbaca6c22bce7b27c7a738b1d1bf69e1","category":"Sites"}
