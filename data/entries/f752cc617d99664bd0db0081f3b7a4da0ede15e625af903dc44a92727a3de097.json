{"title":"26 Years Ago&#8230;","link":"https://kottke.org/24/03/26-years-ago","date":1710431705000,"content":"\n        <p>On this day in 1998, 26 freaking years ago, I started writing this blog. Iâ€™ve <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/03/membership-pricing\">talked</a> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/03/kottkeorg-redesigns-with-2024-vibes\">at you</a> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/02/welcome-back-to-the-site-edith\">a lot</a> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/02/hows-it-going-today\">about</a> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/23/10/introducing-the-new-kottke-comments\">the site</a> recently, so Iâ€™ll be brief. Last year on this anniversary, <a href=\"https://kottke.org/23/03/kottke-is-25-years-old-today\">I wrote</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>My love for the web has ebbed and flowed in the years since, but mainly itâ€™s persisted â€” so much so that as of today, Iâ€™ve been writing kottke.org for 25 years. A little context for just how long that is: kottke.org is older than Google. 25 years is more than half of my life, spanning four decades (the 90s, 00s, 10s, and 20s) and around 40,000 posts â€” almost cartoonishly long for a medium optimized for impermanence.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>And still having fun. Perhaps more fun than ever. Thanks to all of you for being a part of it.</p>\n\n<p>P.S. I hope youâ€™ll forgive me taking advantage of any <em>26-years!-I-love-this-place!</em> feelings you might have today to ask that if you find value in what I do here, Iâ€™d appreciate if youâ€™d support the site <a href=\"https://kottke.org/members/\">by purchasing a membership</a>. And to everyone who has supported the site over the years, thank you so much!</p>\n\n <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/kottke.org\">kottke.org</a></p>\n\n <p>ðŸ’¬ <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/03/26-years-ago\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> â†’</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"f752cc617d99664bd0db0081f3b7a4da0ede15e625af903dc44a92727a3de097","category":"default"}
