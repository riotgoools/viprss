Heâ€™s the pioneer of dub reggae, which must be the genre of music with the most bass. And one of the tricks that he used was to record a bass line and then to play it back through a huge speaker in a room thatâ€™s resonantâ€¦and record that. So it enhances the resonance of the bass. You also hear something of the shaking of the room. So that was one of the tricks that we used to give a sort of a very tactile sense to this spiritual adventure that Paulâ€™s going on.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>There are several other videos on this topic should you desire to rabbit-hole: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkf_rdROyWw\">The Sounds of Dune</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-v2pbKWIV_g\">How The Sounds of Dune Were Made</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KHcbp8szrY\">Dune Sound Design Explained</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWV3Om6oHCM\">Director Denis Villeneuve and Sound Team on Dune</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76GrBO7sYec\">Dune: Part Two | Deeper into the Desert: The Sounds of the Dune</a>:</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Dune\">Dune</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/film%20school\">film school</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/movies\">movies</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/video\">video</a></p>\n\n         <p>ðŸ’¬ <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/05/listening-to-sand-the-sound-design-of-dune\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> â†’</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"5cfef46e57453c35594915150e5232c81f5ddb91bb3335147034574b1e1f69b2","category":"default"}
