He is an educator after all.</p><p>I read his newsletter, <a href=\"https://www.oneusefulthing.org/?ref=bradbarrish.com\">One Useful Thing</a>, regularly and he recently launched published a companion site called <a href=\"https://www.moreusefulthings.com/?ref=bradbarrish.com\">More Useful Things</a>, no doubt due to his his forthcoming book, <a href=\"https://www.moreusefulthings.com/book?ref=bradbarrish.com\">Co-Intelligence: Living and Working with AI</a>. I pre-ordered, which grants me access to special GPTs. Such a cool promotional idea.</p><figure><img src=\"https://bradbarrish.com/content/images/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/co-intelligence-by-ethan-mollick.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>I realize this all may read like a shill.
