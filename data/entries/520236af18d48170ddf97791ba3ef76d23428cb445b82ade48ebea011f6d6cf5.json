I was pretty impressed with how open they were about its usage. They’re taking a conservative approach, see it as a potential tool and will be helping kids explore it for things like structuring their writing, not writing for them and using its inevitable hallucinations to help teach media literacy and critical thinking, which I think is pretty cool. But man, a lot of parents are freaked out.</p>\n<p>Also, I sat with my daughter and ChatGPT’s voice interface last week. I prompted it to help her study for a vocabulary test, on which she proceeded to get 100%, which is encouraging. I especially like that it removes some of the inevitable friction with parents helping kids with homework, which the school discourages anyway.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"micro.brad","siteHash":"27daae1c149c6ec5a964b1fe9266f5a58f96cfb4b36e39006f255c6b2b53a76d","entryHash":"520236af18d48170ddf97791ba3ef76d23428cb445b82ade48ebea011f6d6cf5","category":"Sites"}
