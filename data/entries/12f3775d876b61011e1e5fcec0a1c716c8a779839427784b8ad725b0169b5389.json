Because it uses Twitter for identity. It and bingeworthy.io are the two apps I miss the most. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+1999.io\">1999 was a rewrite</a> of blogging software from the point of view of both 1999 and 2016. Both timeframes. I had learned a lot inbetween, and the art of online interaction had moved forward a lot. I had become a user of Facebook, and was impressed with how their software worked. I was imploring them to turn it into a blogging system, it was achingly close. When I realized they weren't going to do it, I set out to do it myself, how I imagined Facebook would do a blogging system. Of course I didn't have their source code, so I built it from scratch. </p>\n<p>Because 1999 used Twitter for identity, I couldn't use it. I also couldn't use Radio, because it ran on Windows and a now-obsolete version of the Mac OS. It's made me think that maybe in a few years or even months you might not be able to use <a href=\"https://feedland.com/\">FeedLand</a> or <a href=\"http://drummer.land/\">Drummer</a>. Then I thought about how I can better future-safe them for users. And that led me to adding a simple feature to FeedLand that will help if a FeedLand server you depend on should go off the air.
