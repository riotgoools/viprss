It came breathtakingly close on the first attempt, but it repeated part of the story.

Of course it isn't really creative. I know. Yadda yadda. </p>\n<p>Finally I got something that I could live with that I liked but was imperfect. I decided that since the motto of my blog is \"It's even worse than it appears\" that an obvious imperfection is totally consistent with the philosophy, and we move onward.

I am doing a new podcast feed for the blog. This feed is designed to get through Apple's submission process so it can be listed in their podcast database.
