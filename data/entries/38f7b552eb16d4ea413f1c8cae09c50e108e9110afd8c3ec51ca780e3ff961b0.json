Be the Only.","link":"https://kottke.org/24/03/dont-be-the-best-be-the-only","date":1710878632000,"content":"\n        <p>I’ve been dipping in and out of Kevin Kelly’s <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0593654528/ref=nosim/0sil8\">Excellent Advice for Living: Wisdom I Wish I’d Known Earlier</a> for the last few months and keep coming back to one of his tidbits of advice:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>Don’t be the best. Be the only.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/5mDRqHhR6ZE\">a short clip</a> from <a href=\"https://tim.blog/2023/04/28/kevin-kelly-excellent-advice-for-living-transcript/\">a longer interview</a>, Kelly explains what he means by this:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>You want to be doing something where it’s hard to explain to your mother what it is that you do. So it’s like, “What is it? Well, it’s not quite radio. I don’t know. It’s like talking.” And so that’s where you want to be. You want to be the only. You want to — and that’s a very high bar because it requires a tremendous amount of self-knowledge and awareness to get to that point, to really understand what it is that you do better than anybody else in the world. And for most of us, it takes all our lives to figure that out.</p>\n\n<p>And we also, by the way, need family, friends, colleagues, customers, clients, everyone around us to help us understand what it is that we do better than anybody else because we can’t really get there by yourself. You can’t do thinkism, you can’t figure your way there, you have to try and live it out. And that’s why most people’s remarkable lives are full of detours and dead ends and right turns because it’s a very high bar. But if you can get there — you don’t need a resume, there’s no competition. And it’s easy for you because you’re doing it. You’re not looking over your shoulder, you’re just right there. So don’t aim to be the best. Be the only.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Although it works in many situations, my interpretation of this aphorism is from the point of view of a creative person. There’s a point in your work/career/journey when you reach an escape velocity of sorts from your peers and the world around you. What you offer to others is just different enough that you become your own category of one: nothing but you will do. Not better, different. I don’t know if I’m there yet in my creative trajectory, but it’s been a worthy goal to pursue — it takes you inside yourself (in a healthy way) and away from “comparison is the thief of joy” territory.</p>\n\n<p>Kelly states in the foreword of his book that much of his advice was gleaned from elsewhere so I decided to track down where this one might have come from. Legendary concert promoter Bill Graham used a similar phrase in a banner describing the Grateful Dead <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GratefulDead/status/1558226836068470788\">at a 1991 concert for the band</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>They’re not the best at what they do, they’re the only ones that do what they do.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Grateful Dead: not the best, but the only. That sounds about right.</p>\n\n <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/books\">books</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Excellent%20Advice%20for%20Living\">Excellent Advice for Living</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Kevin%20Kelly\">Kevin Kelly</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/working\">working</a></p>\n\n <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/03/dont-be-the-best-be-the-only\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"38f7b552eb16d4ea413f1c8cae09c50e108e9110afd8c3ec51ca780e3ff961b0","category":"default"}
