{"title":"Collision Course","link":"https://www.usv.com/writing/2024/06/collision-course/","date":1717617793000,"content":"<p>We are in the middle of two significant technological shifts happening simultaneously and also intertwined. AI and web3 may have different starting points and timelines but they are both fundamental advances in how computers can transform what we are able to do and how we can do it. They also have both shifted from unique verticals to horizontal ingredients. At USV, we’ve been investing in web3 and AI for many years, but recently we moved away from categorizing our portfolio in these buckets. Instead, we think of them as core components or foundational infrastructure, often necessary to best accomplish a utility for a customer. You can no longer transfer money across borders as quickly or cheaply on web2 architecture as you can utilizing stablecoins. You can’t record and process notes from a meeting or a physician’s interaction with a patient as efficiently as you can with AI. There are long lists of applications of each we are interested in but, maybe most of all, we are excited that these two tectonic shifts are on a collision course and set to reinforce each other. In a moment where two huge and relatively new atomic units of creation are charging forward at the same time, the moment where they collide will create a tremendous amount of new energy. </p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.usv.com/writing/2024/06/collision-course/\">Collision Course</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.usv.com\">Union Square Ventures</a>.</p>","author":"Rebecca Kaden","siteTitle":"http://www.usv.com/feed","siteHash":"628cf95acf2204bb0b1633ad294b90483a47fc067742fc28c14bbe7ca7e45bd8","entryHash":"5bc424eaddd151abe8662c83d1fe5ad31fd804fd1c2a3701b310f57799fab3df","category":"default"}
