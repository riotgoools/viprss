We have entered the age where innovative methods of measurement, such as computer vision and deep learning, can reveal how American life has changed.</p>\r\n<p>Researchers at the National Bureau of Economic Research compiled footage of four urban public spaces, two in New York and one each in Philadelphia and Boston, from 1979-1980 and again in 2008-2010. These snapshots of American life, roughly 30 years apart, reveal how changes in work and culture might have shaped the way people move and interact on the street.</p>\r\n<p>The videos capture people circulating in two busy Manhattan locations, in Bryant Park in midtown and outside the Metropolitan Museum of Art on the Upper East Side; around Boston’s Downtown Crossing shopping district; and on Chestnut Street in downtown Philadelphia. One piece of good news is that at least when it comes to our street behavior, we don’t seem to have become more solitary. From 1980 to 2010 there was hardly any change in the share of pedestrians walking alone, rising from 67% to 68%.</p>\r\n<p>A bigger change is that average walking speed rose by 15%. So the pace of American life has accelerated, at least in public spaces in the Northeast. Most economists would predict such a result, since the growth in wages has increased the opportunity cost of just walking around. Better to have a quick stroll and get back to your work desk.</p>\r\n<p>The biggest change in behavior was that lingering fell dramatically. The amount of time spent just hanging out dropped by about half across the measured locations. Note that this was seen in places where crime rates have fallen, so this trend was unlikely to have resulted from fear of being mugged. Instead, Americans just don’t use public spaces as they used to. These places now tend to be for moving through, to get somewhere, rather than for enjoying life or hoping to meet other people. There was especially a shift at Boston’s Downtown Crossing. In 1980, 54% of the people there were lingering, whereas by 2010 that had fallen to 14%.</p>\r\n<p>Consistent with this observation, the number of public encounters also fell. You might be no less likely to set off with another person in tow, but you won’t meet up with others as often while you are underway. The notion of downtown as a “public square,” rife with spontaneous or planned encounters, is not what it used to be.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>I prefer the new arrangements, but of course not everybody does.  The researchers are <span><a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.nber.org/people/ariannasalazar\">Arianna Salazar-Miranda</a>, </span><span><a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.nber.org/people/zhuangyuan_fan\">Zhuangyuan Fan</a>, </span><span><a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.nber.org/people/michael_baick\">Michael B.
