While working to a brief and respecting the look of the Games, he still managed to maintain his own playful and joyful style.</p>\n\n<p>This is why eight mascots are hidden within the posters. In fact, whatever age you are, there is something within the artwork that you will be able to enjoy.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>The biggest images of the poster I can find <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Paris2024/status/1764803011585458192\">are here</a> if you want to zoom in to see the details. There are also zoomed-in images and videos <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/ugogattoni/\">on Gattoniâ€™s Instagram</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The Olympic poster is the twin of the poster for the Paralympic Games, also created by Gattoni:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/olympic-poster-2024-02.jpg\" srcset=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=500,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/olympic-poster-2024-02.jpg 500w, /cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/olympic-poster-2024-02.jpg 1200w\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1300\" height=\"1626\" alt=\"illustration of the 2024 Summer Paralympic Games\" /></p>\n\n<p>Together, they create <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/C4GdYoENfbD/\">one unified view of the 2024 Summer Games</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If youâ€™d like to buy your own version of the poster, <a href=\"https://shop.olympics.com/en/paris-2024/home-and-office-wall-art/t-3411668641+d-20336698-19420+z-9-1479375065\">check out the official Olympics store</a>.</p>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/2024%20Summer%20Games\">2024 Summer Games</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/art\">art</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/illustration\">illustration</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Olympic%20Games\">Olympic Games</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Paris\">Paris</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/sports\">sports</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Ugo%20Gattoni\">Ugo Gattoni</a></p>\n\n         <p>ðŸ’¬ <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/08/whats-in-the-box-the-olympics-medalists-box\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> â†’</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"845b8eab6277dcc6abd70c903de4a6a77414f66cc08d91fe1b56828cee9443de","category":"default"}
