The goal of this book is to create an authentic portrait of the country, showcasing the diversity of its people and the vastness of its natural landscapes.</p>\n\n<p>We conducted over 100 hours of interviews, received 20 hours of home tour footage and hundreds of photographs, to create the illustrations and short stories about each family.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>It sounds like they worked hard at finding kids from all kinds of different backgrounds (especially with just 50 slots to fill):</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>- Families who live in a variety of dwellings, from houseboats and yurts to farms, Native reservations, and Air Force bases</p>\n\n<p>- Children with adoptive families, stepfamilies, single-parent families, two moms or dads, and those who live with their grandparents</p>\n\n<p>- Children living with health conditions such as leukemia and muscular dystrophy</p>\n\n<p>- Families from a range of social, religious, and economic backgrounds</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>This looks like a fantastic book â€” you can read more about it <a href=\"https://allaboutusbook.com/\">on the website</a> or <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1797213709/ref=nosim/0sil8\">pre-order from Amazon</a> or <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/a/2966/9781797213705\">Bookshop</a>.</p>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/All%20About%20U.S.\">All About U.S.</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/books\">books</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Jenny%20Volvovski\">Jenny Volvovski</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Matt%20Lamothe\">Matt Lamothe</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/USA\">USA</a></p>\n\n         <p>ðŸ’¬ <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/07/all-about-us-a-look-at-the-lives-of-50-real-kids-from-across-the-united-states\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> â†’</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"d75fce34ecaa6ab28a6d7f76cd4c9c02d9bd3b12116d36b8411bceeb91d4c1dc","category":"default"}
