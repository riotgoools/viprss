In everything we look at, we see partly a reflection of ourselves — a projection of an internal model seeking to approximate the actuality. If we are conscious enough and unafraid enough of being surprised, we will keep testing the model against reality, incrementally ceding the imagined to the actual. One measure of love — perhaps the deepest measure — is the willingness to remove the projection in order to perceive what is truly there. There is both sorrow and consolation in knowing that although we can only ever glimpse parts of the totality beyond us, we can keep trying to see more clearly in order to love more deeply. </p>\n<p>I am reminded of a passage from <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Living-Mountain-Celebration-Cairngorm-Mountains/dp/0857861832/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>The Living Mountain</em></strong></a> (<a href=\"http://www.worldcat.org/title/living-mountain-a-celebration-of-the-cairngorm-mountains-of-scotland/oclc/926960556&amp;referer=brief_results\" target=\"_blank\"><em>public library</em></a>) — that <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2018/03/19/the-living-mountain-nan-shepherd/\">uncommon masterpiece of attention and affection</a> by the Scottish mountaineer and poet <strong>Nan Shepherd</strong> (February 11, 1893–February 23, 1981) — illustrating this paradox of perception.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/NanShepherd_ColoriezedByMariaPopova.jpg?resize=680%2C411&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"680\" height=\"411\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/NanShepherd_ColoriezedByMariaPopova.jpg?w=997&amp;ssl=1 997w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/NanShepherd_ColoriezedByMariaPopova.jpg?resize=240%2C145&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/NanShepherd_ColoriezedByMariaPopova.jpg?resize=320%2C193&amp;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/NanShepherd_ColoriezedByMariaPopova.jpg?resize=768%2C464&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/NanShepherd_ColoriezedByMariaPopova.jpg?resize=600%2C362&amp;ssl=1 600w\" /></p>\n<p>Up in the Scottish Highlands, Shepherd discovers how the illusions of perception depend on one’s position, physical as much as psychic. She writes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>A scatter of white flowers in grass, looked at through half-closed eyes, blaze out with a sharp clarity as though they had actually risen up out of their background. Such illusions, depending on how the eye is placed and used, drive home the truth that our habitual vision of things is not necessarily right: it is only one of an infinite number, and to glimpse an unfamiliar one, even for a moment, unmakes us, but steadies us again.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This overwhelming infinity of possible perceptions is what attention evolved to protect us from — that <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2013/08/12/on-looking-eleven-walks-with-expert-eyes/\">“intentional, unapologetic discriminator,”</a> selecting a handful of parts out of the totality in order to construct the projected image. </p>\n<p>Without a conscious clearing of the lens, the eye sees what the mind has already imagined. </p>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/renemagritte_thefalsemirror.jpg?resize=680%2C458&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"680\" height=\"458\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/renemagritte_thefalsemirror.jpg?w=2099&amp;ssl=1 2099w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/renemagritte_thefalsemirror.jpg?resize=320%2C216&amp;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/renemagritte_thefalsemirror.jpg?resize=600%2C404&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/renemagritte_thefalsemirror.jpg?resize=240%2C162&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/renemagritte_thefalsemirror.jpg?resize=768%2C517&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/renemagritte_thefalsemirror.jpg?resize=1536%2C1035&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/renemagritte_thefalsemirror.jpg?resize=2048%2C1380&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/renemagritte_thefalsemirror.jpg?w=1360&amp;ssl=1 1360w\" /><figcaption>René Magritte. <em>The False Mirror</em>. 1929.

Why some blocks of stone, hacked into violent and tortured shapes, should so profoundly tranquillise the mind I do not know. Perhaps the eye imposes its own rhythm on what is only a confusion: one has to look creatively to see this mass of rock as more than jag and pinnacle — as beauty… A certain kind of consciousness interacts with the mountain-forms to create this sense of beauty. Yet the forms must be there for the eye to see. And forms of a certain distinction: mere dollops won’t do it. It is, as with all creation, matter impregnated with mind: but the resultant issue is a living spirit, a glow in the consciousness, that perishes when the glow is dead. It is something snatched from non-being, that shadow which creeps in on us continuously and can be held off by continuous creative act. So, simply to look on anything, such as a mountain, with the love that penetrates to its essence, is to widen the domain of being in the vastness of non-being. Man has no other reason for his existence.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Meanwhile on another landmass, Frida Kahlo was confronting the challenge of fully knowing another, <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2013/04/19/frida-kahlo-diary-love-letters/\">writing</a> to the complicated love of her life that “only one mountain can know the core of another mountain” — a poetic reminder that getting to know one another’s depths may be the supreme “continuous creative act,” the great triumph of perception over projection.</p>\n<p>Complement with Oliver Sacks on <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2023/11/23/oliver-sacks-illusions/\">the necessity of our illusions</a> and Iain McGilchrist on <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2023/05/10/iain-mcgilchrist-the-matter-with-things/\">how we render reality with attention as an instrument of love</a>, then revisit the young Charles Darwin’s <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2024/05/19/darwin-messiah/\">encounter with God in the mountains</a> and the surrealist French poet and philosopher René Daumal on <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2020/09/02/rene-daumal-mount-analogue/\">the mountain and the meaning of life</a>.</p>\n<hr /><h3>donating = loving</h3><p>For seventeen years, I have been spending hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars each month composing <em>The Marginalian</em> (which <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2021/10/22/brain-pickings-becoming-the-marginalian/\">bore the outgrown name <em>Brain Pickings</em></a> for its first fifteen years).
