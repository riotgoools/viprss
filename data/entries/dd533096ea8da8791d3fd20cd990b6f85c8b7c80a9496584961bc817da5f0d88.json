Does it live up to it's lofty goal? Read\non to find out!</p>\n<h2>Aesthetic</h2>\n<p>ðŸ“¸<a href=\"https://%F0%9F%94%A5.pixels.wtf/blog/image/2017/antank-case-for-nintendo-switch-review-a.jpg\">Front of case</a>\nðŸ“¸<a href=\"https://%F0%9F%94%A5.pixels.wtf/blog/image/2017/antank-case-for-nintendo-switch-review-b.jpg\">Back of case</a>\nðŸ“¸<a href=\"https://%F0%9F%94%A5.pixels.wtf/blog/image/2017/antank-case-for-nintendo-switch-review-c.jpg\">Back of case, open</a>\nðŸ“¸<a href=\"https://%F0%9F%94%A5.pixels.wtf/blog/image/2017/antank-case-for-nintendo-switch-review-d.jpg\">Game compartment on the back</a>\nðŸ“¸<a href=\"https://%F0%9F%94%A5.pixels.wtf/blog/image/2017/antank-case-for-nintendo-switch-review-e.jpg\">Recline level I</a>\nðŸ“¸<a href=\"https://%F0%9F%94%A5.pixels.wtf/blog/image/2017/antank-case-for-nintendo-switch-review-f.jpg\">Recline level II</a>\nðŸ“¸<a href=\"https://%F0%9F%94%A5.pixels.wtf/blog/image/2017/antank-case-for-nintendo-switch-review-g.jpg\">Recline level III</a></p>\n<p>The outside of the case has a matte finish that feels <em>quite</em> good. The back has\ntwo release mechanisms that expand the case vertically to allow insertion of\nyour Switch. Below both mechanisms are kickstands with three levels of recline.\nI only used them while testing as I prefer to use handheld mode on the go.\nThere certainly isn't any space for kickstand mode on the MBTA! Near the bottom\nof the case are holes for the Switch's heat vents and a power button followed\nby four thunderbolts to signify how much charge is available. They alight blue\nwhen charging. The top of the case hides a compartment for storing two Switch\ngames horizontally. The side of the case features USB-C charging. YUS!</p>\n<h2>Portability</h2>\n<p>ðŸ“¸<a href=\"https://%F0%9F%94%A5.pixels.wtf/blog/image/2017/antank-case-for-nintendo-switch-review-h.jpg\">Side of case with Switch</a>\nðŸ“¸<a href=\"https://%F0%9F%94%A5.pixels.wtf/blog/image/2017/antank-case-for-nintendo-switch-review-i.jpg\">Back of case with Switch</a>\nðŸ“¸<a href=\"https://%F0%9F%94%A5.pixels.wtf/blog/image/2017/antank-case-for-nintendo-switch-review-j.jpg\">Top of case with Switch</a>\nðŸ“¸<a href=\"https://%F0%9F%94%A5.pixels.wtf/blog/image/2017/antank-case-for-nintendo-switch-review-k.jpg\">Detached Joy-Con with cased Switch</a>\nðŸ“¸<a href=\"https://%F0%9F%94%A5.pixels.wtf/blog/image/2017/antank-case-for-nintendo-switch-review-l.jpg\">Fanny pack view I</a>\nðŸ“¸<a href=\"https://%F0%9F%94%A5.pixels.wtf/blog/image/2017/antank-case-for-nintendo-switch-review-m.jpg\">Fanny pack view II</a>\nðŸ“¸<a href=\"https://%F0%9F%94%A5.pixels.wtf/blog/image/2017/antank-case-for-nintendo-switch-review-n.jpg\">Slipcases are a no-go with the case</a></p>\n<p>The case by itself doesn't weigh much but when you insert the Switch, you can\n<em>definitely</em> notice the difference (if you play in handheld mode often). I was\nable to squeeze my Switch and case inside a fanny pack but it was a tight fit.\nDon't expect this to work with your nifty Super Mario Odyssey slipcase, that\nain't happening. <em>Of course</em>, you could always store the battery case itself in\nthe drawstring bag that comes with it.</p>\n<h2>Real-world Usage</h2>\n<p>I didn't measure the charge time for the case itself but it's roughly an hour\nand a half to two hours. I used my MacBook Pro power brick to charge so I'm not\nsure if that made a difference versus the default power brick it comes with.\nDuring my playtest with Super Mario Odyssey, I noticed the case didn't recharge\nmy Switchâ€¦it basically kept it from dying and was effectively a portable\nwall-charger. I assume graphically-intensive games prevent charging AND battery\nreplenishment so that was a little discouraging. I got <em>at least</em> a half-hour\nof extended playtime thanks to this charger though and that's what counts.</p>\n<h2>Should you buy this?</h2>\n<p>If you play your Switch a LOT while nowhere near a USB-C charger, absolutely. I\ncan see this being a <em>great</em> addition to any traveler as well. I wish I had\nthis with me in Japan for the bullet train rides, I was using the available\nsocket to me for charging my computer. Also, China Southern Airlines did not\nhave appropriate sockets for me to charge my computer. Instead of sleeping to\npass the time, I could've been playing Mr Shifty or Zelda.</p>\n<p>Even for occasional travel, having a Switch charger that envelopes the system\nis a great idea. I have an Anker USB-C charger and it's a brick. Sure, I can\ncharge my Switch with it but it's unwieldy and it <em>sucks</em> dealing with cables.\nI'm loving the one port life with as little cables as possible and Antank made\nthat a little bit bearable. You can buy the Antank charger on Amazon<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Switch-Battery-Charger-Portable-6500mAh-Extended/dp/B07314ZP7L\">1</a>\nfor $47.</p>\n<p>If you have an existing USB-C charger and don't care about having a case that\nfits your Switch, there is absolutely no need to get this. It's more of a\nconvenience thing, not a necessity. ðŸ•¸</p>\n<h2>P.S.</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>I was approached by a representative for Antank to purchase and review their\ncharger. I was refunded after purchasing.</li>\n<li>It occurs to me that I never tested how much the case would recharge my\nSwitch while it was turned <em>off</em>. I'll get on that and update this post.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<hr />\n","author":"","siteTitle":"the webb blog","siteHash":"d87386c8de21b16d23a4d22ceb0991728c5b4e4486d627490c6fcde14e563300","entryHash":"dd533096ea8da8791d3fd20cd990b6f85c8b7c80a9496584961bc817da5f0d88","category":"Sites"}
