{"title":"[RIDGELINE] Death and Not Death Along the Kiso-ji [Part 2]","link":"https://craigmod.com/ridgeline/161/","date":1681776000000,"content":"Ridgeliners —\nMany have died since the last time I walked the Kiso-ji. I mean, this is obvious and folks are dying everywhere all the time, but I’m talking about people running places along the road and sometimes the places themselves.\nUntil last month, I hadn’t been to the Kiso Valley since my 2019 Nakasendō walk, the first SPECIAL PROJECTS walk, the SMS walk.
