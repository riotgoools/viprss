{"title":"Will strong AI raise or lower interest rates?","link":"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/874644920/0/marginalrevolution~Will-strong-AI-raise-or-lower-interest-rates.html","date":1711688874000,"content":"<p>That is the topic of <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-03-27/ai-could-have-a-surprising-effect-on-interest-rates?utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;cmpid%3D=socialflow-twitter-view&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_content=view&amp;sref=htOHjx5Y\" target=\"_blank\">my latest Bloomberg column</a>.  Here is one excerpt:</p>\r\n<blockquote><p>First, as a matter of practice, if there is a true AI boom, or the advent of artificial general intelligence (<a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence\" target=\"_blank\">AGI</a>), the demand for capital expenditures (capex) will be extremely high. Second, as a matter of theory, the productivity of capital is a major factor in shaping real interest rates. If capital productivity rises significantly due to AI, real interest rates ought to rise as well.</p>\r\n<p>Think about capex in a world of AI. The scurry to produce more high-quality semiconductor chips will continue. Those investments are not easy or <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-03-04/has-bidenomics-worked-it-s-too-soon-to-say?sref=htOHjx5Y\" target=\"_blank\">cheap</a>. But the demand for investment will not stop there. The more that AI is integrated into lives and business plans, the higher will be the <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://caseyhandmer.wordpress.com/2024/03/12/how-to-feed-the-ais/\" target=\"_blank\">demand</a> for computation. That will induce a significant expansion of energy infrastructure.</p>\r\n<p>Again, those are not cheap investments. Northern Virginia, for example, is now facing a major dilemma along these lines, and not only because of AI. The region is home to major data centers, and now needs the equivalent of several large nuclear power plants to meet <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/03/07/ai-data-centers-power/\" target=\"_blank\">projected</a> energy demands.</p>\r\n<p>And that could be just the beginning of the rise in capex. AI is already driving some <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaFold\" target=\"_blank\">advances</a> in the pace of scientific discovery, a trend that can be expected to continue. Imagine, for instance, if AI made water desalination cost-effective in many parts of the world. All of a sudden there would be more demand to develop more parts of California, Arizona and Nevada. The US would build more real estate, using more energy in the process. Saudi Arabia, the UAE and many other places might do the same, boosting overall demand for investment yet higher.</p>\r\n<p>Demand for space travel and satellite launches seems to be rising as well, partly because of AI. Software innovation is driving a lot of progress on the hardware side. Less optimistically, AI-driven warfare and drone combat may rise in importance, as already is true in Ukraine and the Middle East. This is bad news that will nevertheless drive further investment.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Note that in the longer run:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Still, it makes sense to be prepared for a reversal of the long-run trend of falling real interest rates — at least for several decades, until AI-driven progress creates more wealth to replenish stocks of savings, lowering real rates once again.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>The most interesting general question is, if strong AI really is taking off, what is the best way of earning money from that reality?  Please apply the theory of tax incidence to any and all possible answers.</p>\r\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/03/will-strong-ai-raise-or-lower-interest-rates.html\">Will strong AI raise or lower interest rates?</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com\">Marginal REVOLUTION</a>.</p>\r\n<img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/874644920/0/marginalrevolution\" />\r\n<div><a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/874644920/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/874644920/marginalrevolution,\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/874644920/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/x.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/874644920/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/874644920/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/03/will-strong-ai-raise-or-lower-interest-rates.html#respond\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/comments20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/03/will-strong-ai-raise-or-lower-interest-rates.html/feed\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/commentsrss20.png\" /></a><h3>Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/03/is-there-hope-for-evidence-based-policy.html?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=is-there-hope-for-evidence-based-policy\">Is there Hope for Evidence-Based Policy?</a></li><li><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/03/my-conversation-with-fareed-zakaria.html?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=my-conversation-with-fareed-zakaria\">My Conversation with Fareed Zakaria</a></li><li><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/03/strong-ai-and-the-o-ring-model.html?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=strong-ai-and-the-o-ring-model\">Strong AI and the O-Ring model</a></li></ul> </div>","author":"Tyler Cowen","siteTitle":"Marginal Revolution","siteHash":"242a3a39129b36e0c574c3796ca7ef3cf8af967286c2998fabf7240d1ad52a47","entryHash":"5b1782eb7b8839043cd8e490834f60ae55df5cc1aa742c420bf7873e7bb095ec","category":"default"}
