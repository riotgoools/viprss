Eventually, the sun bleaches out the parts of the paper not covered, leaving an imprint of the photopositive object in the color of the pigment used in the coating — a ghostly beauty with the chromatic quality of a watercolor and the feeling-tone of a poem. </p>\n<p>On the first of January the following year, Somerville’s results were published as <em>On the Action of the Rays of the Spectrum on Vegetable Juices</em> in the <em>Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society</em> — not under her own name, since women could not publish in scientific journals, but under Herschel’s, who gave her full credit. </p>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/marysomerville.jpg?resize=680%2C827&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Mary Somerville (Portrait by Thomas Phillips)\" width=\"680\" height=\"827\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/marysomerville.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/marysomerville.jpg?resize=240%2C292&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/marysomerville.jpg?resize=320%2C389&amp;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/marysomerville.jpg?resize=768%2C934&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/marysomerville.jpg?resize=600%2C730&amp;ssl=1 600w\" /><figcaption>Mary Somerville (Portrait by Thomas Phillips)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Condensing the solar spectrum through a lens of flint glass and projecting it through a pinhole onto thick white letter paper washed with various pigments and compounds — from “the velvety petals of a scarlet geranium” to the juice of the beet-root — Somerville discovered that the juices of the same plant produce different colors depending on what portion of the spectrum they are exposed to and whether they are extracted with water or alcohol. Some of the results were entirely counterintuitive, rendering colors very different from those of the flower — the dark orange nasturtium, for instance, turned the paper Prussian blue when exposed to light. Somerville marveled at how “the action of the different parts of the spectrum seems very capricious” — a delightful unpredictability that recurred across all of her experiments. She wrote of one:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The juice of the petals of pale blue <em>Plumbago auriculata</em> in distilled water imparted its tint to writing-paper, which, after exposure to the action of diffused light, acquired a pale yellowish green hue. The part under the lavender and violet rays of the spectrum, repeatedly washed with the juice, assumed a pale brown colour: the indigo rays seemed to have no effect, although from their lowest edge to the distance of half the length of the spectrum below the red rays, a lavender blue image was formed. Under the orange rays a minute indigo-coloured spot appeared, and also a larger spot of the same colour under the yellow, which were soon blended into one, forming a single oblong figure of maximum intensity, surrounded by a halo of paler indigo </p></blockquote>\n<p>This was entirely new insight into the interaction of photons and organic molecules, into the materiality of beauty, into how nature works. Mary Somerville had chipped another fragment of knowledge from the monolith of mystery — the task and measure of the true scientist. </p>\n<p>But as commerce interceded with creativity and the seeds of our insta-culture were planted, the much faster — and much more toxic — chemical imaging processes like daguerreotype and tintype became favored over the slow, gentle work of sunlit flowers. </p>\n<p>Expelled from the realm of science and commercial technology, anthotypes became the province of artists. </p>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/emilydickinson.jpg?resize=680%2C814&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"680\" height=\"814\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/emilydickinson.jpg?w=1002&amp;ssl=1 1002w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/emilydickinson.jpg?resize=240%2C287&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/emilydickinson.jpg?resize=320%2C383&amp;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/emilydickinson.jpg?resize=768%2C920&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/emilydickinson.jpg?resize=600%2C719&amp;ssl=1 600w\" /><figcaption>Emily Dickinson, daguerreotype, ca. 1847.

Right: anthotype from <em>This Earthen Door</em>.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>But there is also an elegiac undertone to the project: The <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2022/02/04/universe-in-verse-bloom/\">evolution of flowering plants</a> is what made mammals possible — creatures capable of photography and poetry — and yet flowers are now <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/04/science/flower-sex-evolution-bees.html\" target=\"_blank\">evolving to bloom less</a>. Metabolically costly since the start, producing blossoms to attract pollinators is now becoming prodigal as pollinator populations are rapidly declining. Instead of relying on pollinators, many bisexual species — the botanical term for which is <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2021/07/02/perfect-flowers-emily-dickison/\"><em>perfect flowers</em></a> — are evolving to fertilize their own seeds with their own pollen: a process known as <em>selfing</em>. Its haunting downside is that, because <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2021/01/02/the-snail-with-the-right-heart/\">diversity is nature’s fulcrum of resilience</a>, flowers pollinated by selfing replicate their own genes in the next generation of seeds, amplifying their existing vulnerabilities to disease and drought — something cross-pollination prevents by mixing the DNA of different plants into new, adaptive combinations of genes. (I am reminded of Iris Murdoch’s lovely notion that beauty and art grant us an opportunity for <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2019/10/21/iris-murdoch-unselfing/\"><em>unselfing</em></a>, disrupting the ruminative replication of our beliefs and mental states with something magnificently other — and what is psychological resilience if not the ability to see beyond our suffering, and what is compassion if not the ability to step outside the self and take in the other with a gasp of tenderness.)</p>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.amandamarchand.com/this-earthen\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/emily_anthotype1.jpg?resize=680%2C453&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"680\" height=\"453\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/emily_anthotype1.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/emily_anthotype1.jpg?resize=320%2C213&amp;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/emily_anthotype1.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/emily_anthotype1.jpg?resize=240%2C160&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/emily_anthotype1.jpg?resize=768%2C511&amp;ssl=1 768w\" /></a><figcaption>Left: page from Dickinson’s herbarium.
