Maybe you‚Äôll get a suggestion for something you‚Äôd like to read.</p>\n\n<p>Here are some books I‚Äôve loved the last few years:<br />\n</p><ul><li>Harlem Shuffle and Crooks Manifesto by Colson Whitehead</li><br />\n<li>Heaven and Earth Grocery and Deacon King Kong and The Good Lord Bird by James McBride</li><br />\n<li>Final Revival of Opal and Nev by Dawnie Walton</li><br />\n<li>Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow by Gabrielle Zevin</li><br />\n<li>Sellout by Dan Ozzi</li><br />\n<li>Gone to the Wolves by John Wray</li></ul><p></p>\n\n<p>This year I‚Äôve really liked: <br />\n</p><ul><li>North Woods by Daniel Mason</li><br />\n<li>Wellness by Nathan Hill</li><br />\n<li>Biography of X by Catherine Lacey (I actually can‚Äôt decide if I liked this or if I just want to talk to people about it. I hated all the characters.)</li><br />\n<li>The Rachel Incident by Caroline O‚ÄôDonoghue </li><br />\n<li>Running the Light by Sam Tallent</li></ul><p></p>\n\n<p>Favorites of all time!!<br />\n</p><ul><li>Undermajordomo Minor by Patrick deWitt and </li><br />\n<li>Gentleman in Moscow by Amor Towles.

Let‚Äôs do a bookclub, right? I‚Äôm not really sure how it would work except for probably we‚Äôd all read the same book at around the same time and then probably we‚Äôd all gather somewhere on this website and talk about the book, probably in a comments thread, though it remains to be seen. Comment down below if y‚Äôall are interested and Jason‚Äôs gonna come back from vacation and I‚Äôll say, ‚ÄúSurprise, buddy, now youse got a book club!‚Äù and then we‚Äôll go from there. <br />\n(And by ‚Äúthere‚Äù I mean we‚Äôll figure out a book and time and method for discussion and then we‚Äôll tell you about it.) </p>\n\n<p>What have you been reading? </p>\n\n <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/books\">books</a></p>\n\n <p>üí¨ <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/03/yall-like-books\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> ‚Üí</p>\n\n    ","author":"Aaron Cohen","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"0c8304d80b5c9f9dc9a0348c7880830fd932580af3fb5ff523c32f99a8327b03","category":"default"}
