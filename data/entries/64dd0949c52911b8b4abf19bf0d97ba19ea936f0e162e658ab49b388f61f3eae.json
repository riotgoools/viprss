{"title":"Where is the lib Joe Rogan?","link":"https://www.garbageday.email/p/where-is-the-lib-joe-rogan","date":1731352308000,"content":"<div><div><h2>Here Are All The Possible Joe Rogans Of The Left</h2><p>Following last week’s brutal election, there has been a lot of soul-searching from liberals about how such a thing could have happened. And, instead of questioning why the Democrats’ were spending so much time trying to appease their “<a href=\"https://x.com/ChrisMurphyCT/status/1855616254049980617?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=where-is-the-lib-joe-rogan\" target=\"_blank\">high-income base</a>,” most of the election post-mortem has boiled down to vague assertions that liberals needed their own Joe Rogan to win. </p><p>It’s laughable to think that President-elect Donald Trump’s appearance on Rogan won him the election. But the idea of a “liberal Joe Rogan” is interesting, if only because it requires defining what Rogan is and means politically in America.</p><p>As anyone who has suffered through Rogan’s three-hour-plus episodes can tell you, he’s not actually <i>that</i> political. Instead, he exists as an important algorithmic node for different buckets of men’s interests. Bodybuilding, weed, comedy, UFC, I Fucking Love Science stuff — if you’re a man and you like any of these things and you look them up on a platform like YouTube, you will eventually find Rogan. And his platforming of libertarian and right-wing politicians is crucial for connecting those ideologies to those aforementioned interests.</p><p>But less than 15 years ago we had TV hosts like Jon Stewart and bands like Green Day who were able to make progressivism feel just as relevant and countercultural as Trumpism feels to young American men now. And this could easily flip again — even without heaps of <a href=\"https://www.usermag.co/p/why-democrats-wont-build-their-own?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=where-is-the-lib-joe-rogan\" target=\"_blank\">Republican dark money</a>. You just have to meet young men where they are, talk to them in a way they think is cool, and guide them left. And so, Garbage Day researcher Adam Bumas and I put together a list of 10 possible liberal or leftist Rogan candidates and one honorable mention. Notice how few on our list are actual podcasters.</p><div><img src=\"https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/d02b7104-e775-4097-b38e-8ae7cab86de2/Screenshot_2024-11-11_at_1.04.09_PM.png?t=1731348274\" /><div><span><p>(Twitch/hasanabi)</p></span></div></div><h3>Pod Save America</h3><p>We included the <i>Pod Save</i> guys only so we could immediately say it’s probably not going to be them. They’re, frankly, too old, as is their audience. They also feel way too establishment in both tone and presentation. It’s possible they discover some kind of cool factor during the second Trump era, but it’s more likely that their entire strain of American liberalism gets flushed down the drain over the next four years. They’re also too political. The Rogan X factor is packaging politics into general interest content for men. Maybe they should launch a bodybuilding show?</p><h3>Red Letter Media</h3><p>Red Letter Media, the popular film review YouTube channel, is decidedly not political at all. That said, they’ve also <a href=\"https://x.com/siddhantadlakha/status/1855126688985657597?s=12&amp;t=GArJOEJ41SKT7sLfzFsugQ&amp;utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=where-is-the-lib-joe-rogan\" target=\"_blank\">carved out</a> a fascinating anti-corporate, pro-nerd film criticism philosophy that is also casually very socially progressive. Which is huge for <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/kattenbarge.bsky.social/post/3lamccvrlcs2x?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=where-is-the-lib-joe-rogan\" target=\"_blank\">young men being bombarded</a> by millions of “Woke killed <i>Star Wars</i>” videos. Are these guys going to interview Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez? Probably not. But they might make her watch <i>Videodrome</i> or something.</p><h3>Conner O'Malley</h3><p>The comedian’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDIJ45Bba6nzrGL5v8b7fMw?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=where-is-the-lib-joe-rogan\" target=\"_blank\">solo work</a> has slowly transformed into maybe the single best articulation of 21st-century American life. Especially as it appears (and appeals) to lonely young men. His <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/rap-world/?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=where-is-the-lib-joe-rogan\" target=\"_blank\">most recent video</a> was actually <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zfu9EwFQsfU&amp;utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=where-is-the-lib-joe-rogan\" target=\"_blank\">screened in theaters</a>, but they all still work perfectly on YouTube and TikTok. And it would make a lot of sense for him to start actually taking clearer positions on social ills. His recent moves like appearing in <i>I Saw The TV Glow</i> show it’s definitely on his mind.</p><h3>Travis Kelce</h3><p>The Super Bowl winner/pop megastar boyfriend/<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/26/style/art-but-sports.html?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=where-is-the-lib-joe-rogan\" target=\"_blank\">icon of hanging out with your boys</a> has parlayed all the media attention from his romance with Taylor Swift into <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czxl1wnpjgyo?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=where-is-the-lib-joe-rogan\" target=\"_blank\">a nine-figure podcast deal</a>. Kelce <a href=\"https://ftw.usatoday.com/2024/11/chiefs-travis-kelce-instagram-like-endorsing-kamala-harris?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=where-is-the-lib-joe-rogan\" target=\"_blank\">stayed quiet </a>this election even as Swift endorsed Harris, but he’s currently defending his brother for<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5904078/2024/11/06/travis-kelce-jason-phone-incident/?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=where-is-the-lib-joe-rogan\" target=\"_blank\"> breaking a guy’s phone</a> for calling him a homophobic slur. Which is still bipartisan, for better and worse. Though, Kelce might be too big and too mainstream actually. Part of Rogan’s appeal is that he’s not a traditional media figure and Kelce seems interested in going down that route.</p><h3>Hasan Piker</h3><p>Mega-popular Twitch streamer Hasan Piker is probably the closest to a Rogan figure we have on our list. He’s masculine, he’s funny, he’s tapped into video game culture, and he’s aggressively left-wing. But he might be too political to capture the mainstream like Rogan has. More importantly, Piker is a streamer. Rogan has a podcast, you can download it on any app, and listen to it on the way to school or work. Livestreaming will never be as accessible. Maybe the <i>Pod Save</i> guys should hire him and let him yell at them for the next four years lol.</p><h3>Jamelle Bouie</h3><p>This is a bit of a curveball, but hear us out. The <i>New York Times </i>columnist has been building a really solid following <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@jamellebouie?lang=en&amp;utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=where-is-the-lib-joe-rogan\" target=\"_blank\">on TikTok</a>, specifically for his calming, sensible, and well-argued videos about American politics. He’s not an obvious choice here, but if he keeps reaching young audiences the way he has, it’s not unthinkable. He’s also <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/unclear-and-present-danger/id1592411580?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=where-is-the-lib-joe-rogan\" target=\"_blank\">got a podcast</a>. If it’s not Bouie, it could easily be another journalist following the same playbook. What are the laid off <i>VICE </i>writers doing right now? Give them a bag of drugs and get them on TikTok.</p><h3>Sam Reich/Dropout</h3><p>Most Joe Rogan fans are too young for <i>Fear Factor</i>. Similarly, many fans of Sam Reich and his independent media network Dropout weren’t around for <i>College Humor</i>. Nonetheless, Dropout has been a hit both financially and culturally. Its shows connect the comedy world with other big subcultures like <i>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</i> and all of them have a breezy left-liberal sensibility. And now that Dropout is a streaming service unto itself, they’ll need more content, and reckoning with a second Trump administration is definitely on the table.</p><h3>Anthony Fantano</h3><p>On paper, Fantano is perfect. He’s ditched his weird alt-right flirtations. He’s got a huge platform. He has some cachet with the cultural dynamos of the punk and hip-hop worlds. He seems sort of lefty kinda? And he dominates an entire world of general interest content. Unfortunately, his fans, the music industry, and the internet at large all sort of hate him. If he can fix that, he’s in a good spot.</p><h3>Kai Cenat</h3><p>Readers might remember Cenat from the time his fans got <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Union_Square_riot?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=where-is-the-lib-joe-rogan\" target=\"_blank\">arrested for rioting</a> in New York City last year. Since then, his reach has only grown. His near-constant Twitch streams have included guests recently like Nicki Minaj and John Cena. And seeing as how both presidential candidates appeared on Twitch streams this year, the Harris team should have definitely talked to Cenat. If there’s a streamer who’s able to cross over to the enormous audience who will never watch a stream, he’s an obvious candidate.</p><h3>The <i>Chapo Trap House</i> cinematic universe</h3><p>Is it a cop out to lump the <i>Chapo </i>guys in with their regular collaborators like Adam Friedland and Stavros Halkias? Probably. But it’s worth throwing them all under one umbrella for now as <i>Chapo</i> figures out what their show means in a post-Bernie world. They’re even more overtly political than Piker, but it’s possible someone in their stable figures out how to grab the mainstream. And if that happens they have a decade of experience converting attention into direct political messaging.</p><h3>Honorable mention: Hbomberguy </h3><p>We were going to leave YouTuber Hbomberguy, real name Harry Brewis, off this list because he’s, unfortunately, British. But he’s big, he’s political, and he’s fun. The main problem with Hbomberguy, or any leftist YouTuber, or BreadTuber, like him, though, is output.
