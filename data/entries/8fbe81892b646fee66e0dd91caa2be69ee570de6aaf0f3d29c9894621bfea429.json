All love is an outstretched hand of curiosity reaching for knowledge — a tender acknowledgement of a reality that is not yourself and a lively interest in its interiority. Bertrand Russell captured this in his <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2017/05/08/bertrand-russell-the-scientific-outlook/\">essential distinction between “love-knowledge” and “power-knowledge,”</a> for it is only by means of love that we get to know anything deeply — a landscape, a person, the world — and it is love that beckons forth our own secret knowledge of what makes life worth living. </p>\n<p>That is what poet <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2024/08/30/kamau-zuzu-find-a-way/\">Aracelis Girmay</a> and her artist sister Ariana Fields explore in <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/What-You-Know-Aracelis-Girmay/dp/1592703216/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>What Do You Know?</em></strong></a> (<a href=\"https://search.worldcat.org/title/1201226291\" target=\"_blank\"><em>public library</em></a>), inspired by the closing lines of Sharon Olds’s tender poem “Looking at Them Asleep.” (“When love comes to me and says / What do you know? I say This girl, this boy.”)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/What-You-Know-Aracelis-Girmay/dp/1592703216/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\"
