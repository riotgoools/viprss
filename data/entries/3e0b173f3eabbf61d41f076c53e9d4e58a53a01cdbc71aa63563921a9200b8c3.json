I had no road map, so I followed other people’s maps. I felt pressured to obey the “shoulds.” I contorted myself into 10-step marketing and sales strategy plans, and hated it. I forced myself to be on social media. I hustled. I undercharged and undervalued myself in doing client work, while overcompensating in labor and energy — because I felt some concoction of fraud and imposter syndrome. I felt that I need to prove my worthiness, expertise, and professionalism. I said too many “yeses” to the wrong people. I worked too much, too hard, and got burnt out. I was an <a href=\"https://keningzhu.com/journal/a-moody-creatives-guide-to-work-overwhelm\" target=\"_blank\">overwhelmed, moody artist</a> constantly disappearing and ghosting my work. I felt embarrassed to share myself, and turned off by the idea of selling anything. </p><p>even though I still made money and supported my life — I’d say that I barely had a real “business,” because it wasn’t a business that felt <strong><em>energetically</em></strong> supportive to me — how I wanted to exist in the world. </p><p>before this, I didn’t know that another<em> </em>way was even possible. </p><p>but now I do. </p><p><br /></p><h1>business as energy   </h1><p>I think the transformations started last summer, when I began diving into human design and exploring what it means to be <a href=\"https://keningzhu.com/journal/7-processes-for-energetically-aligned-business-flow\" target=\"_blank\">energetically aligned in work</a>. I realized that my successes and milestones never came from sheer force of my effort, sweat, and labor — but instead, from finding <em>alignment</em> with my energy. </p><p>and yes — while energy sounds like such a nebulous, wishy-washy thing — time and time again, life gave me material proof that it was real. I’ll define energy here as simply: some combination of: (1) respecting your inner resources, (2) extremely clear desires/intentions, (3) creative power (4) surrender and (5) an unwavering commitment to the desire. it’s a mysterious thing that I’ve seen work, but not in the way of manifestation-guru speak. it’s much deeper than that — though I’m still working out exactly how. </p><p>a few months ago, another break-through came for me when I wrote about the <a href=\"https://keningzhu.com/journal/artist-entrepreneur\" target=\"_blank\">artist-entrepreneur</a> — my way of recounciling my relationship to art and money, and the false dichotomy our society creates between the two. it gave me a new model of how to be an artist integrated and <em>in</em> the world — to share my creative gifts in service of my values <em>and</em> make money — as a byproduct of my giving. of course, this required a lot of shadow work around money and self-worth. </p><p>recently, I created a framework in thinking about <a href=\"https://keningzhu.com/journal/build-a-labyrinth-not-a-funnel\" target=\"_blank\">business as a labyrinth</a>. I explored what it meant to <a href=\"https://keningzhu.com/journal/feeling-safe-in-creative-work-business\" target=\"_blank\">create safety for yourself</a> in your business, and use it as a container to practice deeply <a href=\"https://keningzhu.com/journal/business-as-honoring-creative-energy\" target=\"_blank\">cherishing your creative energy</a>. the radical difference here for me was shifting my focus to <strong>energy, not labor</strong> — as the limited resource to work with. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure>\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/51e8148de4b01c1eb79c1977/5a47b053-d0cb-4f73-9a36-073aea8648ed/business_i_desire_87.jpg?format=1000w\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1600\" srcset=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/51e8148de4b01c1eb79c1977/5a47b053-d0cb-4f73-9a36-073aea8648ed/business_i_desire_87.jpg?format=100w 100w, https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/51e8148de4b01c1eb79c1977/5a47b053-d0cb-4f73-9a36-073aea8648ed/business_i_desire_87.jpg?format=300w 300w, https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/51e8148de4b01c1eb79c1977/5a47b053-d0cb-4f73-9a36-073aea8648ed/business_i_desire_87.jpg?format=500w 500w, https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/51e8148de4b01c1eb79c1977/5a47b053-d0cb-4f73-9a36-073aea8648ed/business_i_desire_87.jpg?format=750w 750w, https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/51e8148de4b01c1eb79c1977/5a47b053-d0cb-4f73-9a36-073aea8648ed/business_i_desire_87.jpg?format=1000w 1000w, https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/51e8148de4b01c1eb79c1977/5a47b053-d0cb-4f73-9a36-073aea8648ed/business_i_desire_87.jpg?format=1500w 1500w, https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/51e8148de4b01c1eb79c1977/5a47b053-d0cb-4f73-9a36-073aea8648ed/business_i_desire_87.jpg?format=2500w 2500w\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <h1>my business as hammock i lay down in </h1><p>when I weave all of those thoughts together, what I’m left with is what I’ve always desired: the infinite possibility of reimagining what a business can be, completely from scratch — a full <strong><em>seven</em></strong> years after I first jumped off the cliff to work for myself. I really did take my time. </p><p>I feel the expansiveness and realization that I can design a business however I want — to fit my very personal rhythms, preferences, and idiosyncrasies. </p><p>now I know: </p><p>a business is not about hustling hard, chasing work, or proving my worthiness in exchange for money. </p><p><strong>a business is a soft hammock I weave by hand</strong> <strong>— <em>of</em> my creative practices, and to hold my creative practices.</strong> it is the vessel and tapestry which connects, flows, and carry those practices — to have presence in the world. </p><p>my business is a place where I can lay down and rest. stargaze and dream, and imagine new things. it’s designed to be extremely energy efficient — woven to fit the contours of my (creative and energetic) body. its whole purpose can be summarized as: <em>energy-efficient imaginative processes.</em> </p><p>it’s travel-friendly and mobile: I can take it to jungles, to the wide open sea, to outer space. it’s compact and yet infinitely elastic — it’s a web that can stretch and expand; which can catch and support others who wander into my world, seeking guidance. </p><p>when I hold this metaphor in my mind, my body feels a sense of deep relief. to create a business like a hammock is to give myself permission to rest. to let things come to me, without struggle. </p><p><strong>my business is a place where I give myself permission to be effortless</strong> — and still feel supported, safe, and connected to my environment. this weaving of threads takes time, of course. but at the end of it, I find myself building a flexible, soft, cozy structure that allows me to <em>be</em> myself, and be in movement with the world. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n<hr />\n\n\n  <p><strong>see also: </strong></p><p><a href=\"https://keningzhu.com/journal/feeling-safe-in-creative-work-business\">feeling safe in creative work &amp; business</a><br /><a href=\"https://keningzhu.com/journal/business-as-honoring-creative-energy\" target=\"_blank\">honoring your creative energy in business</a><br /><a href=\"https://keningzhu.com/journal/energy-studies\">energy studies: an ongoing practice</a><br /><a href=\"https://keningzhu.com/journal/artist-entrepreneur\" target=\"_blank\">the way of the artist-entrepreneur</a><br /></p><p><strong>go to:</strong> <a href=\"https://keningzhu.com/entrepreneurship\">growing a business</a><strong><br /></strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n  ","author":"Kening Zhu","siteTitle":"kening zhu","siteHash":"ef8a94b9fc20c32a4ee7d94ee971337d278e8b2fafe747123e4eb5cea026e84e","entryHash":"3e0b173f3eabbf61d41f076c53e9d4e58a53a01cdbc71aa63563921a9200b8c3","category":"Sites"}
