It keeps you from doing your work. It keeps you explaining over and over again, your reason for being. Somebody says you have no language and so you spend 20 years proving that you do. Somebody says your head isnâ€™t shaped properly so you have scientists working on the fact that it is. Somebody says that you have no art so you dredge that up. Somebody says that you have no kingdoms and so you dredge that up. None of that is necessary. There will always be one more thing.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Morrison said this during a speech titled The Humanist View at Portland State University on May 30, 1975. The text above, which is slightly different than youâ€™ll see on social media or Goodreads, is taken <a href=\"https://www.mackenzian.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Transcript_PortlandState_TMorrison.pdf\">directly from the transcript</a>.
