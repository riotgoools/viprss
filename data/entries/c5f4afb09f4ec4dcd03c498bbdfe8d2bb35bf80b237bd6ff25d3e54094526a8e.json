But one of his longest-running goals seemed to be slipping out of his reach and, well, I don’t want to spoil what happens.</p>\n\n<p>I will say however that I think it’s good and healthy to let go of your goals and dreams if they do not serve the person you have become since setting them. I’ve <a href=\"https://kottke.org/16/07/ive-never-had-a-goal\">never been much of a goal person</a>, but I’ve definitely had thoughts about directions I’ve wanted to head or things I’d like to have had happen that just aren’t relevant for what’s important to me right now. If it’s not working for you, chalk it up to sunk cost and let it go.</p>\n\n<p>I got this link <a href=\"https://waxy.org/\">via Andy</a>, who said, “I allow myself one link to a Casey Neistat video every ten years, and this is that video.” Lol.</p>\n\n        \n\n <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Casey%20Neistat\">Casey Neistat</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/running\">running</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/sports\">sports</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/video\">video</a></p>\n\n <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/02/chasing-impossible-dreams\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"c5f4afb09f4ec4dcd03c498bbdfe8d2bb35bf80b237bd6ff25d3e54094526a8e","category":"default"}
