Of course, I paid him back within the\nfirst four months of 2017. Anyhoo, we stayed for two weeks (my other buddy\nOliver stayed for a week) and it was one of <em>the</em> best experiences of my life.\nHoly moly. I still have a LOT of footage to get through. I've been meaning to\npost about my trip for quite some time but 60GB+ is too much to go throughâ€¦or\nmaybe I'm just lazy. Here's a couple pics to whet your appetite:</p>\n<p>ðŸ“¸<a href=\"https://%F0%9F%94%A5.pixels.wtf/blog/image/2017/year-in-review-a.jpg\">Japanese money!</a>\nðŸ“¸<a href=\"https://%F0%9F%94%A5.pixels.wtf/blog/image/2017/year-in-review-b.jpg\">I finally understand the significance of 7-11</a>\nðŸ“¸<a href=\"https://%F0%9F%94%A5.pixels.wtf/blog/image/2017/year-in-review-c.jpg\">SQUAAAAAD!</a>\nðŸ“¸<a href=\"https://%F0%9F%94%A5.pixels.wtf/blog/image/2017/year-in-review-d.jpg\">Nighttime Marauders</a>\nðŸ“¸<a href=\"https://%F0%9F%94%A5.pixels.wtf/blog/image/2017/year-in-review-e.jpg\">The only train delay I experienced and it was for five minutes</a>\nðŸ“¸<a href=\"https://%F0%9F%94%A5.pixels.wtf/blog/image/2017/year-in-review-f.jpg\">Rainy day in Tokyo</a>\nðŸ“¸<a href=\"https://%F0%9F%94%A5.pixels.wtf/blog/image/2017/year-in-review-g.jpg\">I found a dope spot for us to take pics</a>\nðŸ“¸<a href=\"https://%F0%9F%94%A5.pixels.wtf/blog/image/2017/year-in-review-h.jpg\">Cloud seeker</a>\nðŸ“¸<a href=\"https://%F0%9F%94%A5.pixels.wtf/blog/image/2017/year-in-review-i.jpg\">Shrimp curry at Mt Fuji</a>\nðŸ“¸<a href=\"https://%F0%9F%94%A5.pixels.wtf/blog/image/2017/year-in-review-j.jpg\">24 hours?

After all,\nwe were financing things ourselves so it made the most sense. This was another\ngreat experience, especially because the weather leading up to and immediately\nafter our wedding day was absolutely <em>dreadful</em> and cold. We took that as a\nsign of the universe approving our union.</p>\n<p>ðŸ“¸<a href=\"https://%F0%9F%94%A5.pixels.wtf/blog/image/2017/year-in-review-l.jpg\">Marriage in autumn</a></p>\n<p>If you're interested in learning how we met, you can check out both her\npost<a href=\"http://sincerelyshantelle.com/blog/how-i-met-my-husband\">1</a> and mine<a href=\"/2017-10-29-how-i-met-my-wife.txt\">2</a>.</p>\n<h2>I lost my job</h2>\n<p>The startup I was working for went out of business in November. This was a\nmere <em>four days</em> after my wedding. ðŸ¤¬ Yeah I know, fun right? Christmas a\nmonth later too? <em>Good grief</em>! Studies show that money is one of the major\nreasons behind divorce so I guess my wife and I were lucky that this happened\nimmediately. Even though job searching is immensely stressful (and annoying),\nhaving ample time to work on projects I reserved for nights and weekends has\nbeen a plus.</p>\n<p>Let this be a lesson to you: if you work for a startup that's focused <em>solely</em>\non B2B and they poo-poo the idea of B2C for additional revenue even though\ntheir big partners are moving slower than molasses, flee as soon as you can.\nThat big partner can <em>and will</em> outlive your dinky startup.</p>\n<h2>Became more productive</h2>\n<p>This was a direct result of losing my job. Per my post about neglected\nprojects<a href=\"/2017-07-27-neglected-projects.txt\">3</a>, I went through the list and either redesigned or sunset them. My\nsunset'd projects aren't 100% gone, just positioned in a way that I don't feel\nbad about seeing them. A great way to ensure that is to get your project(s) to\na nice stopping point <em>and</em> leave yourself notes.</p>\n<p>With those out of the way, I started work on a social network called Socii.\nYou can read more about<a href=\"/2017-12-30-who-creates-social-networks.txt\">4</a> it or visit the site<a href=\"https://socii.network\">5</a> to sign up for updates!</p>\n<h2>FIN</h2>\n<p>Here's my top nine Instagram photos, based on likes.</p>\n<p>ðŸ“¸<a href=\"https://%F0%9F%94%A5.pixels.wtf/blog/image/2017/year-in-review-m.jpg\">Top nine Instagram pics of 2017</a></p>\n<p>This may be the last time I do one of these, I want Socii to replace Instagram\nfor me. ðŸ•¸</p>\n<hr />\n<hr />\n","author":"","siteTitle":"the webb blog","siteHash":"d87386c8de21b16d23a4d22ceb0991728c5b4e4486d627490c6fcde14e563300","entryHash":"997ae658ddcc34f82f2d0c06de6d813bfa509cd2922bb02ac200ac8a53843a4b","category":"Sites"}
