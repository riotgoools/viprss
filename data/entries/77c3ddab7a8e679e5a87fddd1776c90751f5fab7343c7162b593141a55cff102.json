(This is false, and ironically Musk <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/musk-pushes-debunked-dominion-voting-conspiracy-theory-campaign-appear-rcna175985\">himself pushed a debunked Dominion voting machine conspiracy</a> theory at a Trump rally last month).</p><p>The rampant election fraud conspiracies on Threads show how <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/10/16/instagram-limits-political-content-shadowban-election-posts/\">Meta‚Äôs efforts to downrank and minimize journalistic content</a> on the app have helped to create a vacuum in which misinformation thrives unchecked and users are unable to find reliable, accurately reported news. The conspiracies also show how many self-described liberals have grown increasingly conspiratorial and unable to distinguish fact from fiction in a chaotic and broken information ecosystem.</p><p>\"What is happening with conspiracy theories among liberals is the thing that's always happened with conspiracy theories throughout history,‚Äù said Mike Rothschild, author of <em>The Storm Is Upon Us: How QAnon Became a Movement, Cult and Conspiracy Theory of Everything. </em></p><p><em>‚Äú</em>People are looking for explanations for why something happened and they don't want to admit that the thing that happened is a reflection on a candidate that they put all their faith into. So they make up conspiracy theories to explain it instead.\"</p><p>The shift towards a ‚Äúpost-truth‚Äù online landscape, where people across the political spectrum wrap themselves in their own conspiratorial bubbles, is not just about ignorance or lack of media literacy. It is, as <em>The Atlantic's</em> Charlie Warzel <a href=\"https://archive.ph/x6snw#selection-787.36-787.70\">described it,</a> a new \"choose-your-own-adventure reality\" and \"<a href=\"https://archive.ph/4o5Hr#selection-695.37-695.83\">something darker than a misinformation crisis</a>.\"¬†</p><p>The fracturing of a shared reality goes beyond politics too. We are seeing it manifested in news and information about pop culture, celebrities, world events, sports, and myriad other topics.¬†</p><p>Rather than engage in the stark realities of things like natural disasters, political upheaval, a global pandemic, or societal challenges, people are retreating into their own alternative realities. At its core, it's denialism. It‚Äôs a deliberate rejection of the truth and anyone who challenges this denialism will be met with hate, hostility, and abuse.</p><div><div><div><p>User Mag is a reader-supported publication.
