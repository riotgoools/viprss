(This is false, and ironically Musk <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/musk-pushes-debunked-dominion-voting-conspiracy-theory-campaign-appear-rcna175985\">himself pushed a debunked Dominion voting machine conspiracy</a> theory at a Trump rally last month).</p><p>The rampant election fraud conspiracies on Threads show how <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/10/16/instagram-limits-political-content-shadowban-election-posts/\">Meta‚Äôs efforts to downrank and minimize journalistic content</a> on the app have helped to create a vacuum in which misinformation thrives unchecked and users are unable to find reliable, accurately reported news. The conspiracies also show how centrist liberal Democrats have grown increasingly conspiratorial and unable to distinguish fact from fiction in a chaotic and broken information ecosystem.</p><p>\"What is happening with conspiracy theories among liberals is the thing that's always happened with conspiracy theories throughout history,‚Äù said Mike Rothschild, author of <em>The Storm Is Upon Us: How QAnon Became a Movement, Cult and Conspiracy Theory of Everything. ‚Äú</em>People are looking for explanations for why something happened and they don't want to admit that the thing that happened is a reflection on a candidate that they put all their faith into.

Meta already institutes draconian content moderation policies. The problem here is a societal one and, while it is manifesting on Threads, it‚Äôs bigger than any one platform. </p><p>As trust in mainstream media declines, partisan narratives on both sides are gaining traction, leading many liberals to adopt conspiratorial thinking similar to their conservative counterparts and giving rise to a phenomenon known online as <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/07/14/blueanon-conspiracy-theories-trump-rally-shooting/\">BluAnon</a>, a play on the right-wing conspiracy theory QAnon.</p><div><figure><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fda380ab6-defe-4279-a043-5af9b384c397_2048x1024.jpeg\"><div><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fda380ab6-defe-4279-a043-5af9b384c397_2048x1024.jpeg\" width=\"1456\" height=\"728\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fda380ab6-defe-4279-a043-5af9b384c397_2048x1024.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fda380ab6-defe-4279-a043-5af9b384c397_2048x1024.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fda380ab6-defe-4279-a043-5af9b384c397_2048x1024.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fda380ab6-defe-4279-a043-5af9b384c397_2048x1024.jpeg 1456w\" loading=\"lazy\" /><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>In July, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/07/14/blueanon-conspiracy-theories-trump-rally-shooting/\">well known pro-Biden Democrat users on Threads</a> pushed conspiracy theories about the assassination attempt on Trump, claiming that the shooting was a false flag and an inside job orchestrated by the Secret Service. These claims reached millions. Some of the same users had previous claimed, without evidence, that the media was working directly with a small group of illuminati-type \"elites\" to \"take out\" Biden and force him out of the race.¬†</p><p>\"Conspiracy theories provide a convenient excuse for the dissonance that people feel between the hopes and reality,\" Imran Ahmed, founder and chief executive of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, told me in July. \"What you‚Äôre seeing now is both political parties in the U.S. showing signs of heightened conspiracism. Conspiracy theories provide an easy story people can tell themselves that gives them a reason not to engage with reality as it is.‚Äù</p><p>The shift towards a ‚Äúpost-truth‚Äù online landscape, where people across the political spectrum wrap themselves in their own conspiratorial bubbles, is not just about ignorance or lack of media literacy. It is, as <em>The Atlantic's</em> Charlie Warzel <a href=\"https://archive.ph/x6snw#selection-787.36-787.70\">described it,</a> a new \"choose-your-own-adventure reality\" and \"<a href=\"https://archive.ph/4o5Hr#selection-695.37-695.83\">something darker than a misinformation crisis</a>.\"¬†</p><p>The fracturing of a shared reality goes beyond politics too. We are seeing it manifested in news and information about pop culture, celebrities, world events, sports, and myriad other topics.¬†</p><p>Rather than engage in the stark realities of things like natural disasters, political upheaval, a global pandemic, or societal challenges, people are retreating into their own alternative realities. At its core, it's denialism. It‚Äôs a deliberate rejection of the truth and anyone who challenges this denialism will be met with hate, hostility, and abuse.</p><p>Journalists reporting on critical issues like climate change, election integrity, or public health will face even more harassment and threats as conspiracy theorists dismantle public trust and incite increasingly violent opposition to factual information.</p><p>Widespread denialism doesn't just threaten individual reporters, it primes society for authoritarianism. We are already seeing how figures like Musk and Trump are working to exploit our broken information ecosystem to dismantle public accountability and erode journalism's already precariously fragile role in our democracy.¬†</p><p>As trust in factual reporting collapses, people will deny even the most rigorously verified truths. This widespread denialism sets the stage for unchecked power, where propaganda thrives, dissent is stifled, and democracy itself is at risk.</p><div><div><div><p>User Mag is a reader-supported publication.
