[notice <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGlo9LzmOME\" target=\"_blank\">how little context is in that prompt</a>]</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>The Alchian and Allen theorem, often summarized by the phrase “shipping the good apples out,” postulates that when a fixed cost (such as shipping) is added to both high-quality and low-quality goods, consumers will tend to choose the higher-quality option because the relative price difference between high and low quality is diminished. This effect occurs because the fixed cost makes the higher-quality good relatively cheaper in comparison to the lower-quality good.</p>\r\n<p>To determine if this theorem applies as much to shipping tourists as it does to shipping goods, we need to consider a few key factors:</p>\r\n<p>1. **Fixed Costs**:</p>\r\n<p>– For goods, fixed costs like shipping fees are straightforward and directly affect the relative prices.</p>\r\n<p>– For tourists, the “fixed cost” could be interpreted as travel expenses (e.g., airline tickets, visas) or associated costs of traveling.</p>\r\n<p>2. **Relative Quality**:</p>\r\n<p>– When applied to tourists, the theorem would suggest that higher fixed costs of travel might influence tourists to opt for higher-quality destinations or experiences, since the relative additional cost becomes proportionally smaller once the fixed travel expense is incurred.</p>\r\n<p>– In this context, “higher quality” might mean more luxurious accommodations, premium tour packages, or upscale experiences.</p>\r\n<p>3. **Consumer Behavior**:</p>\r\n<p>– Tourists’ behavior may be influenced by the fixed costs of travel, encouraging them to “make the most” of their trip by choosing higher-quality options once the significant travel expense is accepted.</p>\r\n<p>– This behavior aligns with the theorem, suggesting that relatively higher travel costs might steer tourists toward choosing higher-quality experiences to justify the overall expense of the trip.</p>\r\n<p>4. **Elasticity**:</p>\r\n<p>– The elasticity of demand for tourism-related services (e.g., accommodations, dining) and tourism destinations plays a role in how strongly the theorem applies. If tourists are sensitive to price changes in these services, the theorem may have a stronger influence.</p>\r\n<p>– Conversely, if tourists have a fixed budget, they may not escalate their choices in quality as much, but rather optimize within that budget.</p>\r\n<p>In conclusion, the Alchian and Allen theorem can indeed apply to shipping tourists in much the same way it applies to shipping goods. When tourists face substantial fixed costs (like airfare), they might be more inclined to choose higher-quality accommodations, dining options, or experiences to maximize the value of their trip. While the application is not as straightforward as it is with physical goods, the underlying economic principle still holds: the relative attractiveness of higher-quality options increases when fixed costs are a significant factor.</p></blockquote>\r\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/08/the-new-version-of-gpt-4-does-economics.html\">The new version of GPT-4 does economics</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com\">Marginal REVOLUTION</a>.</p>\r\n<img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/902884001/0/marginalrevolution\" />\r\n<div><a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/902884001/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/902884001/marginalrevolution,\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/902884001/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/x.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/902884001/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/902884001/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/08/the-new-version-of-gpt-4-does-economics.html#comments\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/comments20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/08/the-new-version-of-gpt-4-does-economics.html/feed\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/commentsrss20.png\" /></a> \r\n<div><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/08/the-new-version-of-gpt-4-does-economics.html#comments\"><h3>Comments</h3></a><ul><li><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/08/the-new-version-of-gpt-4-does-economics.html#comment-160797144\">Aside from the AI aspects, is the Alchian and Allen ...</a> <i>by BC</i></li><li><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/08/the-new-version-of-gpt-4-does-economics.html#comment-160797122\">Even worse LLMs get good answers for this: I asked gemini, not ...</a> <i>by Bob</i></li></ul></div><h3>Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/08/tabarrok-on-china-on-world-of-daas-podcast.html?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=tabarrok-on-china-on-world-of-daas-podcast\">Tabarrok on China: World of DAAS Podcast</a></li><li><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/08/finally-exchange-rate-models-seem-to-work-pretty-well.html?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=finally-exchange-rate-models-seem-to-work-pretty-well\">Finally, exchange rate models seem to work pretty well</a></li><li><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/08/europeans-deserve-to-be-as-cool-as-americans.html?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=europeans-deserve-to-be-as-cool-as-americans\">Europeans deserve to be as cool as Americans</a></li></ul> </div>","author":"Tyler Cowen","siteTitle":"Marginal Revolution","siteHash":"242a3a39129b36e0c574c3796ca7ef3cf8af967286c2998fabf7240d1ad52a47","entryHash":"57ce0e1f4cff7dccce1b6f2558dcc99de2f52421fb4a9c14f60a9b5736724b12","category":"default"}
