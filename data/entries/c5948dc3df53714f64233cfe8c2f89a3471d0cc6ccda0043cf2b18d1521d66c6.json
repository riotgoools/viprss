Producer Frank Guida has been quoted on subsequent CD reissues that his production sound was exactly what he wanted it to sound like.</p></blockquote>\r\n<p>Bob Roman <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://rec.music.rock-pop-r-b.1950s.narkive.com/9Qlaz18e/the-number-ones-gary-u-s-bonds-quarter-to-three\" target=\"_blank\">wrote</a>:</p>\r\n<blockquote><p>The song opens with muffled crowd noise and a bandleader counting off the beginning of a song. It’s not a live recording, but it sounds like one — and not even like a good one. It sounds like an amazing party happening down the street — wild, frenzied, mysterious, its sound obscured by what might as well be a couple of sets of walls. In any era, it’s crazy that a record this lo-fi managed to hit #1. In the pre-Beatles era where labels were pushing cleaned-up teenage dreamboats, it seems especially strange.</p></blockquote>\r\n<p>So we’ve got amazing hooks, controlled chaos, and extreme innovation?</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>The song also has a lineage.  Bill Wyman put it on one of his solo albums.  It inspired Dion’s “Runaround Sue.”  Bruce Springsteen <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOYMHP89xrg\" target=\"_blank\">played it</a> regularly in his concerts, and later worked with Gary, writing songs for him and doing two albums together.  Most importantly, Paul McCartney references it in his Sgt. Pepper classic “<a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCTunqv1Xt4\" target=\"_blank\">When I’m Sixty-Four</a>“:</p>\r\n<blockquote><p>If I’d been out ’til quarter to three, would you lock the door?</p></blockquote>\r\n<p>In essence Paul is teasing us with the notion that the 64-year-old McCartney might someday still be out there, dancing, rather than knitting tea cozies on the Isle of Wight.  And true to <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com/?s=straussian+beatles\" target=\"_blank\">Straussian form</a>, Paul released the dance song “<a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6LjBCpZqaA\" target=\"_blank\">Dance Tonight</a>” when he was sixty-four, days before turning sixty-five.</p>\r\n<p>In 1963, during a Beatles European tour, Gary U.S. Bonds was the <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.garyusbonds.com/biography.php\" target=\"_blank\"><em>headliner</em></a> for them.</p>\r\n<p>You will note that the lineage of the song runs mostly through white performers, though Gary U.S. Bonds was black (or possibly mixed race).  Perhaps one special feature of Quarter to Three is how it spans black and also white R&amp;B, a rare feature at the time but hearkening back to the much earlier years of the blues, when black and white musical styles could be hard to distinguish.  In addition to the Caribbean vein, <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cgY6rzFEVc\" target=\"_blank\">Gary could span Latino styles as well</a>.</p>\r\n<p>Just as we are finding it impossible to rebuild Notre Dame cathedral as it was, a mere sixty-three years later could any of us still make something akin to “Quarter to Three”?  Or have we lost those “technologies”?</p>\r\n<p>I, for one, have decided to vote in favor of masterpiece status for Quarter to Three.  At least for now.  And by the way <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.garyusbonds.com/tour.php\" target=\"_blank\">Gary U.S. Bonds is still on tour</a>.</p>\r\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/03/how-good-a-song-is-quarter-to-three.html\">How good a song is Quarter to Three?</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com\">Marginal REVOLUTION</a>.</p>\r\n<img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/873445094/0/marginalrevolution\" />\r\n<div><a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/873445094/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/873445094/marginalrevolution,\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/873445094/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/x.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/873445094/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/873445094/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/03/how-good-a-song-is-quarter-to-three.html#comments\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/comments20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/03/how-good-a-song-is-quarter-to-three.html/feed\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/commentsrss20.png\" /></a> \r\n<div><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/03/how-good-a-song-is-quarter-to-three.html#comments\"><h3>Comments</h3></a><ul><li><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/03/how-good-a-song-is-quarter-to-three.html#comment-160729048\">In reply to rsm.
