Twenty years ago, as a 25-year-old inspired by Harry Potter’s Marauder’s Map, he created Dodgeball—turning text messaging into a way for friends to find each other in the city. When the iPhone emerged, he launched Foursquare, riding the convergence of GPS, apps, and our growing comfort with social networks to transform how we interact with places around us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Google bought Dodgeball in 2005 and eventually <a href=\"https://om.co/gigaom/dodgeball-founder-quits-google/?utm_source=CrazyStupidTech&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=with-ai-the-future-of-augmented-reality-is-in\" target=\"_blank\">shut it down in 2009</a>.<a href=\"https://om.co/gigaom/dodgeball-founder-quits-google/?utm_source=CrazyStupidTech&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=with-ai-the-future-of-augmented-reality-is-in\" target=\"_blank\"> Dennis left Google to start</a>Foursquare with his co-founder Naveen Selvadurai. Foursquare rose like a meteor, and<a href=\"https://om.co/gigaom/crowley-foursquare/?utm_source=CrazyStupidTech&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=with-ai-the-future-of-augmented-reality-is-in\" target=\"_blank\"> much of its core functionality was subsumed</a> by Facebook. Mark Zuckerberg has no qualms about copying others’ ideas and then presenting them as his own. Foursquare, sadly, has since lost its preeminence in the location sweepstakes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After giving up his role as the chief executive, Crowley ran the R&amp;D Labs at Foursquare and went off to try a few new ideas. One of them,<a href=\"https://hopscotchlabs.co/?utm_source=CrazyStupidTech&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=with-ai-the-future-of-augmented-reality-is-in\" target=\"_blank\"> Hopscotch Labs</a>, has become his latest startup, he has co-founded with<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/max-sklar-b638464/?utm_source=CrazyStupidTech&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=with-ai-the-future-of-augmented-reality-is-in\" target=\"_blank\"> Max Sklar</a> and<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ajfragoso/?utm_source=CrazyStupidTech&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=with-ai-the-future-of-augmented-reality-is-in\" target=\"_blank\"> Alejandro Fragoso</a>. With<a href=\"https://hopscotchlabs.co/?utm_source=CrazyStupidTech&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=with-ai-the-future-of-augmented-reality-is-in\" target=\"_blank\"> Hopscotch Labs</a>, Crowley is exploring what happens when ubiquitous AirPods meet artificial intelligence. Like his previous ventures, this new project arrives at a moment when certain technologies have become commonplace while others are just becoming possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new company is building a service that leverages the enormous corpus of data in large AI systems and  newly ubiquitous headphones. Then it’s adding the capabilities of a smartphone to surface relevant local information as and when a person walks by a location, such as a restaurant, a cocktail bar, or even a street corner. It feels like a panacea for information overload. Instead of looking into a browser or constantly peeking into a phone, the information comes into our ears or to our other devices, such as glasses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have followed Crowley’s career since 2000. He has a preternatural ability to see the future, especially when it comes to location and information architecture. With Dodgeball, he correctly predicted the confluence of machines responding to our text messages. Foursquare correctly predicted the importance of geolocation as an everyday axis of search and discovery. And that is precisely why I am interested in what Crowley has to say about our future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In my conversation with Crowley, we discuss his latest startups, convergence of new technologies, and what it means for the future. We get into a conversation about AI, our children, and entrepreneurship. He talks about attempting to make sense of it all while staying true to his original mission: building things that help people better experience the world around them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://crazystupidtech.com/archive/with-ai-the-future-of-augmented-reality-is-in/\">Continue Reading @ CrazyStupidTech</a></p>","author":"Om Malik","siteTitle":"Om Malik","siteHash":"56aa7c22de1a9e5680d03082a2a13db78fe214c96b8119e8d54042cbf2d355ae","entryHash":"e6ddd7814de8f1e89f276bd8273e1ff8212763e6ba4ec6faaa0f5cd719f31a61","category":"Sites"}
