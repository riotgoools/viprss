Sometimes, if the common gravitational center is strong enough, they return, they stay. Sometimes they travel on. But they change us all the same. </p>\n<p>The great consolation of the cosmic order is the constancy of its laws, indiscriminate across the immensity of space, unchanged since the beginning of time. That we can predict an eclipse centuries into the future with precision down to the second but not the outcome of an election, that we can foretell the return of a comet but not the return of a friend, is a strange oasis of sanity amid the chaotic uncertainty of life. It is also a mirror — we see ourselves reflected in universe, covet its organizing principles for the chaos of our own lives. </p>\n<p>In this respect, comets — the most erratic of cosmic denizens, with their irregular orbits, fickle periodicity, and mysterious origins in the outermost reaches of space — offer a singular lens on human relationships, that most unpredictable phenomenon in the universe. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Comet-Star-Story-Cosmic-Friendship/dp/159270400X/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/cometandstar1.jpg?resize=680%2C402&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"680\" height=\"402\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/cometandstar1.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/cometandstar1.jpg?resize=320%2C189&amp;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/cometandstar1.jpg?resize=600%2C355&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/cometandstar1.jpg?resize=240%2C142&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/cometandstar1.jpg?resize=768%2C454&amp;ssl=1 768w\" /></a></p>\n<p>Korean musician Lee Juck and artist Lee Jinhee take up these deep and often heavy questions with great levity and loveliness in <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Comet-Star-Story-Cosmic-Friendship/dp/159270400X/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>Comet &amp; Star</em></strong></a> (<a href=\"https://search.worldcat.org/title/1437997334\" target=\"_blank\"><em>public library</em></a>) — the story of a little star whose cosmic loneliness is interrupted by a visit from humanity’s most beloved comet: Halley’s comet, which has inspired <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2017/04/11/jocelyn-bell-burnell-dark-matter-poetry-stanley-kunitz/\">poems</a> and auguries. (“I came in with Halley’s Comet in 1835,” a grown wrote in his 1909 autobiography. “It is coming again next year, and I expect to go out with it.” And so he did — Halley’s comet, which blazes across Earth’s skies once every 76 years, was visible on November 30, 1835, when Samuel Clemens was born, and again on April 21, 1910, when he died as Mark Twain.)</p>\n<p><a

you… be my friend?” But the comet blazes past. </p>\n<p>Loneliness descends again, grey and dim — 76 years of it (which is but a blink in the life of a star, but it is also eternity to wait even a day

“To see takes time, like to have a friend takes time,” Georgia O’Keeffe memorably <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2018/11/15/georgia-okeeffe-flower/\">wrote</a> — but there is also, if you are lucky enough and openhearted enough, that rare miracle of knowing another only a short time yet seeing their naked soul, seeing yourself seen and deeply cherished in their eyes. </p>\n<p><a

the star is no longer lonely — there is deep consolation in the knowledge that the cherished friend will always return, long though the stretches of absence may be; there is singular solace in the understanding that leaving need not be abandonment, that time and space avail not in any true bond, which nothing but indifference can break. (“Meeting and separation are two forms of friendship that contain the same good,” Simone Weil <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2015/08/24/simone-weil-friendship-separation\">wrote to a faraway friend</a>. “Let us love this distance which is wholly woven of friendship, for those who do not love each other are not separated.”) </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Comet-Star-Story-Cosmic-Friendship/dp/159270400X/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/cometandstar5.jpg?resize=680%2C402&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"680\" height=\"402\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/cometandstar5.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/cometandstar5.jpg?resize=320%2C189&amp;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/cometandstar5.jpg?resize=600%2C355&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/cometandstar5.jpg?resize=240%2C142&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/cometandstar5.jpg?resize=768%2C454&amp;ssl=1 768w\" /></a></p>\n<blockquote><p>The star and the comet<br />\neach glowed with joy<br />\nbecause they knew<br />\nthey would meet again.<br />\nAnd they both shone<br />\nbrighter than ever<br />\nin our vast universe.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Comet-Star-Story-Cosmic-Friendship/dp/159270400X/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/cometandstar2.jpg?resize=680%2C402&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"680\" height=\"402\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/cometandstar2.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/cometandstar2.jpg?resize=320%2C189&amp;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/cometandstar2.jpg?resize=600%2C355&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/cometandstar2.jpg?resize=240%2C142&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/cometandstar2.jpg?resize=768%2C454&amp;ssl=1 768w\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Comet-Star-Story-Cosmic-Friendship/dp/159270400X/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/cometandstar20.jpg?resize=680%2C453&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"680\" height=\"453\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/cometandstar20.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/cometandstar20.jpg?resize=320%2C213&amp;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/cometandstar20.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/cometandstar20.jpg?resize=240%2C160&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/cometandstar20.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w\" /></a></p>\n<p>Complement <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Comet-Star-Story-Cosmic-Friendship/dp/159270400X/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>Comet &amp; Star</em></strong></a> with the story of <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2021/05/27/comets-meteors-perseids-leonids/\">the comet behind Earth’s most transcendent celestial spectacle</a> (which might one day destroy us) and these <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2017/01/11/kometenbuch-the-comet-book/\">wonder-smiting medieval paintings of comets</a>, then revisit <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2017/10/12/big-wolf-little-wolf/\"><em>Big Wolf &amp; Little Wolf</em></a> — another tender illustrated parable about loneliness and how friendship transforms us, which remains one of my favorite books of all time. </p>\n<p><em>Illustrations courtesy of Enchanted Lion Books; photographs by Maria Popova</em></p>\n<hr /><h3>donating = loving</h3><p>For seventeen years, I have been spending hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars each month composing <em>The Marginalian</em> (which <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2021/10/22/brain-pickings-becoming-the-marginalian/\">bore the outgrown name <em>Brain Pickings</em></a> for its first fifteen years).
