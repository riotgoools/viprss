{"title":"Mickey 17, a New Film From Bong Joon-ho","link":"https://kottke.org/24/09/mickey-17-a-new-film-from-bong-joon-ho","date":1726678194000,"content":"\n        <p></p>\n\n<p>For his first movie since 2019’s Parasite, filmmaker Bong Joon-ho is coming out with a sci-fi dark comedy film called Mickey 17. The trailer is above and the synopsis <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mickey_17\">from Wikipedia</a> is:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>Wanting to get out of Earth, Mickey Barnes signs up to be an “expendable”: a disposable employee where after one iteration dies, a new body is regenerated with most of their memories intact. After one of his “multiples”, Mickey 17, unintentionally survived a human expedition to colonize the ice world Niflheim, he goes head-to-head with a new multiple, Mickey 18.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Mickey 17 will be out in theaters in late January. I found the trailer for this <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/badideas.bsky.social/post/3l4fffczcup2z\">from Aaron Stewart-Ahn</a>, who says:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>David Zaslav’s Warner Bros has been trying to bury Bong Joon-ho’s sci-fi follow up to Parasite for over a year now, refused to let it play Cannes, and is now dumping it in January. Rumors are Robert Pattinson’s weirdo performance also bothered them which to me means it must be friggin’ awesome.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Per Wikipedia, production wrapped in late 2022 so yeah, it sounds like they didn’t know what to do with it.</p>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Bong%20Joon-ho\">Bong Joon-ho</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Mickey%2017\">Mickey 17</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/movies\">movies</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/trailers\">trailers</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/video\">video</a></p>\n\n         <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/09/mickey-17-a-new-film-from-bong-joon-ho\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"b9484ba75883830239c67b96b5c30fa8d565ffe1aef18262b887b0b0b32ed88e","category":"Sites"}
