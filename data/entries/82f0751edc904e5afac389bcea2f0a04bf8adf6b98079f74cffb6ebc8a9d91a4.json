I was about to write a negative review for a product they can't seem to support, that I depend on, but got <a href=\"https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/09/05/amazonReviewPage.png\">this message</a>. Weird. I bought the product from the page I wanted to review it on. How else would they determine if I actually purchased the product? They don't say. They do offer to tell me a joke if I rate products I've bought. I've heard the company isn't doing that well now that Bezos has stepped aside. Hopefully this is just a bad set of coincidences.","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"82f0751edc904e5afac389bcea2f0a04bf8adf6b98079f74cffb6ebc8a9d91a4","category":"Sites"}
