Sansomâ€™s passing</a>, I wanted to recommend his marvelous <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shardlake_series\">Matthew Shardlake historical crime thrillers</a>, for anyone who isnâ€™t already familiar. I definitely learned and remembered more about Thomas Cromwell-era England from <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B002TZ3EPM/ref=nosim/0sil8\">Dissolution</a> than I did from any textbooks (not that Iâ€™ve read any of those in a while, but still). It was all very visceral in a damp-stone-monastery, heavy cloaks, burning candles, teeth-being-pulled-in-the-Tower-of-London kind of way. Also his novels are just super fun, and the Matthew Shardlake character â€” a sort of proto-detective lawyer â€” is especially memorable. </p>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/books\">books</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/C.J.%20Sansom\">C.J.
