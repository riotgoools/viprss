{"title":"Ayo Edebiri Draws a New Yorker Cartoon","link":"https://kottke.org/24/02/ayo-edebiri-draws-a-new-yorker-cartoon","date":1706896098000,"content":"\n        <p></p>\n\n<p>In June 2021 (pre The Bear), New Yorker cartoonist <a href=\"https://www.zoe-si.com/\">Zoe Si</a> coached <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/ayoedebiri\">Ayo Edebiri</a> through the process of drawing a New Yorker cartoon. The catch: neither of them could see the other’s work in progress. Super entertaining.</p>\n\n<p>I don’t know about you, but Si’s initial description of the cartoon reminded me of an LLM prompt:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>So the cartoon is two people in their apartment. One person has dug a hole in the floor, and he is standing in the hole and his head’s poking out. And the other person is kneeling on the floor beside the hole, kind of like looking at him in a concerned manner. There’ll be like a couch in the background just to signify that they’re in a house.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Just for funsies, I asked ChatGPT to generate a New Yorker-style cartoon using that prompt. Here’s what it came up with:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/plus/misc/images/hole-cartoon-nyer.jpg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" alt=\"A New Yorker style cartoon depicting a man standing in a hole in the floor of an apartment, holding a shovel with only his head and shoulders visible. A woman floats beside him, with a concerned expression.\" /></p>\n\n<p>Oh boy. And then I asked it for a funny caption and it hit me with: “I said I wanted more ‘open space’ in the living room, not an ‘open pit’!” Oof. ChatGPT, don’t quit your day job!</p>\n\n        \n\n <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/art\">art</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/artificial%20intelligence\">artificial intelligence</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Ayo%20Edebiri\">Ayo Edebiri</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/cartoons\">cartoons</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/ChatGPT\">ChatGPT</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/how%20to\">how to</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/video\">video</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Zoe%20Si\">Zoe Si</a></p>\n\n <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/02/ayo-edebiri-draws-a-new-yorker-cartoon\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"7fb8329ebaa9000a83f54cbd4dcf9880ab7abd5c8eef747e12098014af6fd632","category":"default"}
