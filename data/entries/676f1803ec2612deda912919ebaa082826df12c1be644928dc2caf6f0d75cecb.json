For example, if I’m working on RPG Portrait, I may want to discuss growth rates and have it help me prioritize my tasks accordingly. But the growth rates are in a Postgres database, the tasks are in GitHub issues, and it probably needs a bit of the app’s source code too. That’s where recon comes in.</p>\n<div>\n<p><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BU5bV3X5w65DwSMapKcsr0ZvrMRU_Nbi/view?pli=1\"><span>Do large language models need sensory grounding for meaning and understanding?</span></a><span>  (nyu paper)  </span><a href=\"https://openreview.net/pdf?id=BZ5a1r-kVsf\"><span>A Path Towards Autonomous Machine Intelligence Version 0.9.2, 2022-06-27</span></a><span>  (openview)</span></p>\n</div>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/15d2a680-278f-4cdf-be89-4579d6e0bbe5\">Oscars launch fundraising drive as Academy Awards audience shrinks</a> (ft) The Academy of Motion Picture Arts &amp; Sciences is launching a $500mn global fundraising drive to bolster its finances and counter a decades-long decline in the audience for the annual Oscars TV broadcast that generates most of its revenue.  <em>“The Academy is acknowledging the fact that we’re living in a much more globally focused world, a much more globally connected world,”<br />\n</em><br />\n(Legacy media realizing they have perished – ED)</p>\n<div>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.billboard.com/pro/ai-deepfakes-beware-copyright-infringement-cost-big-money/\"><span>AI Deepfakes Beware: Copyright Infringement Can Cost Up To $150,000 Per Copied Work</span></a><span> (billboard)</span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/10/style/westminster-dog-show-agility.html\">The Unwanted Shelter Dog Who Found His Way to Westminster</a>.
