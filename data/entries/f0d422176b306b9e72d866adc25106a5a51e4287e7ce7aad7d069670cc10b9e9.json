{"title":"[RIDGELINE] Why Kissas Intrigue (Places for People)","link":"https://craigmod.com/ridgeline/197/","date":1731110400000,"content":"Ridgeline subscribers —\nHello from Kuwana, a post-town along the Tōkaidō where I’m about to hop on a boat and sail across the Nagoya Bay as part of this little tour. But I’m writing these words from a kissa called Saboten (Cactus). A place that’s been around for fifty-seven years (!!!). It’s a bit grimy. A bit worn in. (What isn’t after fifty-seven years?)
