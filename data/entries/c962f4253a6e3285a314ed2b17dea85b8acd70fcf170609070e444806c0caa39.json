We then talked about how crazy it must have been to live back then (in 790 AD) and see the sun just casually disappear, etc.</p>\n\n<p>And then I was wondering: What’s happening now that people living in the year 3200 will pity us for not understanding? “Wow, can you imagine living back then and not knowing exactly how [viruses appear/cancer strikes/the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voynich_manuscript\">Voynich Manuscript</a> came into existence]? Or precisely what happened at Dyatlov Pass, or on board the <em>Mary Celeste</em>?” (Okay now I’m just googling “<a href=\"https://www.mentalfloss.com/posts/history-greatest-mysteries\">mysteries</a>.”) Anyway, I’m not high, I swear. But please chime in if anything comes to mind. “It must have been so weird to not know what dogs were saying.”</p>\n\n <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/calendars\">calendars</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Maya\">Maya</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/mysteries\">mysteries</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/the%20future\">the future</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Voynich%20Manuscript\">Voynich Manuscript</a></p>\n\n <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/04/whats-happening-now-that-might-only-make-sense-in-1200-years\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Edith Zimmerman","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"c962f4253a6e3285a314ed2b17dea85b8acd70fcf170609070e444806c0caa39","category":"default"}
