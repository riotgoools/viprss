To exist at all is as close as this universe of austere laws and inert matter gets to a miracle. At its most miraculous, life has a musical quality, harmonious and symphonic with meaning. The word <em>person</em> itself takes its root from the Latin for “to sound through.” </p>\n<figure><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/and-pipe-the-little-songs-that-are-inside-of-bubbles-by-dugald-stewart-walker-1920_framed-print?curator=brainpicker\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/walker_bubbles_TheMarginalian.jpg?resize=680%2C941&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"680\" height=\"941\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/walker_bubbles_TheMarginalian.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/walker_bubbles_TheMarginalian.jpg?resize=320%2C443&amp;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/walker_bubbles_TheMarginalian.jpg?resize=600%2C830&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/walker_bubbles_TheMarginalian.jpg?resize=240%2C332&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/walker_bubbles_TheMarginalian.jpg?resize=768%2C1062&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/walker_bubbles_TheMarginalian.jpg?resize=1110%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 1110w\" /></a><figcaption><em>And Pipe the Little Songs that Are Inside of Bubbles</em> by Dugald Stewart Walker, 1920.

Music <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2023/01/06/dacher-keltner-awe-music/\">thrusts our neurobiology into transcendence</a>.

But it is also the language of mortality. “The use of music is to remind us how short a time we have a body,” Richard Powers <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2022/10/15/richard-powers-music/\">wrote</a>.</p>\n<p>Poet, French horn player, and choral singer <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2023/11/18/hannah-fries-night-migration-oliver-caplan/\">Hannah Fries</a> (who is also the visionary editor behind <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2024/05/01/the-universe-in-verse-book/\">the <em>Universe in Verse</em> book</a>) celebrates this enlivening relationship between music, meaning, and mortality in her stunning poem “Let the Last Thing Be Song,” inspired by Radiolab’s episode <a href=\"https://radiolab.org/podcast/91569-memory-and-forgetting\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Memory and Forgetting</em></a> and read here by Hannah herself to the sound of her young son improvising on the piano:</p>\n<p></p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>LET THE LAST THING BE SONG</strong><br />\n<em>by Hannah Fries</em></p>\n<p>i.</p>\n<p>Memory is safest in someone with amnesia.<br />\nBehind locked doors<br />\nglow the unmarred pieces—<br />\nmusical notes humming<br />\nin a jumble, only<br />\nwaiting to be<br />\narranged.</p>\n<p>ii.</p>\n<p>What is left in one<br />\nwho does not remember?<br />\nLove and music. </p>\n<p>Not a name but the fullness.<br />\nNot the sequence of events<br />\nbut order of rhythm and pitch,</p>\n<p>a piece of time in which to exist.</p>\n<p>iii.</p>\n<p>A tone traveling through space has no referent,<br />\nand yet we infer, and yet it<br />\nfinds its way between our cells<br />\nand shakes us.</p>\n<p>Aren’t we all still quivering<br />\nlike tuning forks<br />\nwith the shock of being,<br />\nthe shock of being seen?</p>\n<p>iv.</p>\n<p>When I die, I want to be sung across the threshold.<br />\nDon’t you?
