Surfing was never, to his mind, a job. Even when he was at the apex of the surfing world, he was unimpressed, stubborn. There was no pro tour in those days. “You could work for a board manufacturer, maybe have your own signature-model board,” he told me. “But that meant sell, sell, sell. That was…crass. I mean, the banality. It was antithetical to being able to enjoy being out in the water.”</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Sutherland’s mom, Audrey, sounds like an amazing person:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>Audrey drew up a list of things that every child should be able to do by age sixteen and stuck it on the wall. It read, in part:</p>\n\n<p>- Clean a fish and dress a chicken</p>\n\n<p>- Write a business letter</p>\n\n<p>- Splice or put a fixture on an electric cord</p>\n\n<p>- Operate a sewing machine and mend your own clothes</p>\n\n<p>- Handle a boat safely and competently</p>\n\n<p>- Save someone drowning using available equipment</p>\n\n<p>- Read at a tenth grade level</p>\n\n<p>- Listen to an adult talk with interest and empathy</p>\n\n<p>- Dance with any age</p>\n\n<p>This list changed with the times, adding computers and contraception, and nobody really kept score, but everybody got the idea.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Finnegan wrote <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1594203474/ref=nosim/0sil8\">Barbarian Days</a>, a memoir of his life as a surfer — I loved it.</p>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Jock%20Sutherland\">Jock Sutherland</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/lists\">lists</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/sports\">sports</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/surfing\">surfing</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/William%20Finnegan\">William Finnegan</a></p>\n\n         <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/06/a-long-surfing-life\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"215d84c98405e3b7eca1b5e50a40e0ae27afb5e2804a2c10c897d3354bcd79fb","category":"default"}
