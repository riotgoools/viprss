What an incredible illusion. And I always enjoy an artist who is reticent to give <a href=\"https://www.billbraunart.com/statement\">an artist statement</a> or explain their work:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>I don’t like to give an artist statement because it undoes the premise of my work, trompe l’oeil painting. Literally from the French, trompe l’oeil means “trick the eye”. An artist’s statement might undo the fundamental aim of convincing the viewer, at least for a moment, that what he sees are actual objects and not a painting. The basic rules of trompe l’oeil painting are that objects are rendered in real scale, and totally within a shallow painted space. This type of painting has always been a minor branch of realist painting, but with a very long history. The Athenian painters Xeuxis and Parrhasios in 5th century B.C. (as told by Pliny the Elder in his Natural History) and Roman murals of the 2nd century A.D., 16th century Dutch vanitas painting and the 19th century Philadelphia School painters, Harnett, Peto and Haberle, are examples. Today there are still trompe l’oeil painters around; I am happy to be one of them.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>(via <a href=\"https://tohippo.com/art-like-craft/\">tohippo</a>)</p>\n\n <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/art\">art</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Bill%20Braun\">Bill Braun</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/optical%20illusions\">optical illusions</a></p>\n\n <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/03/extraordinarily-effective-trompe-loeil-paintings-of-paper-craft\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"ae8ee853d578bb142502fe36da09725e5c1f61f1aad8616de09e19f85cd71ec4","category":"default"}
