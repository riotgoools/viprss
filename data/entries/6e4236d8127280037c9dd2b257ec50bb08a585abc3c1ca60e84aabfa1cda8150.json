Iâ€™m gonna be updating it every day or two with new gift guides and things I run across, but I wanted to ask you folks if thereâ€™s anything you would recommend for the list. Please leave a comment below! And donâ€™t forget to include links â€” you can just paste a URL into the comment box and it will autolink it for you. (And comments are editable for 10 minutes, so if you screw it up or forget the link, you have time to fix it.)</p>\n\n<p>If you run an online store or sell products that would be appropriate for holiday gifts, feel free to share your own stuff. (But be reasonable and personable â€” if you paste a press release into my website, Iâ€™m gonna yeet that comment right into the Sun.)</p>\n\n<p>Comments are members-only, but I will also be taking suggestions via email â€” <a href=\"mailto:jason@kottke.org?subject=kottke.org feedback\">send them along</a> and I will make sure they are included below. Thanks!</p>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/kottke.org\">kottke.org</a></p>\n\n         <p>ðŸ’¬ <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/12/any-suggestions-for-the-gift-guide\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> â†’</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"6e4236d8127280037c9dd2b257ec50bb08a585abc3c1ca60e84aabfa1cda8150","category":"Sites"}
