Of all the things you could be spending this amount of time on, maybe it’s just time you stop caring so much.’ I love doing it. There is something that really gets me when the flow of songs is just right. I don’t think most people notice or care and that’s ok. I think part of it is that, once upon a time, before digital music and streaming, when you made a mixtape or a mix CD, it was set. Once it was recorded or burned or whatever, that was the order. Sure, people could fast-forward or skip tracks, but between streaming music and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/jan/02/attention-span-focus-screens-apps-smartphones-social-media\">our seeming inability to focus our attention on much of anything</a>, it’s now <em>too</em> easy to skip. When you skip, you run the risk of missing. When you skip, you miss an opportunity to sit with something that challenges you or makes you uncomfortable. I can think of two tracks on this playlist that, upon first listen, I didn’t really like… until I did. Anyway, I realize as I’m writing this that I’m likely preaching to the choir.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not that you asked, but <em>if</em> someone asked which ten albums from 2024 I recommend they listen to, I’d likley have a different answer for each person, but at least a few of the following albums (in no particular order) would be on each list.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://album.link/us/i/1752836259\">Endlessness by Nala Sinephro</a><br /><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://album.link/us/i/1763934442\">Alligator Bites Never Heal by Doechii</a><br /><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://album.link/us/i/1737990072\">Romance by Fontaines D.C.</a><br /><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://album.link/us/i/1728945682\">Only God Was Above Us by Vampire Weekend</a><br /><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cindylee.bandcamp.com/album/diamond-jubilee\">Diamond Jubilee by Cindy Lee</a><br /><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://album.link/us/i/1717923523\">Bite Down by Rosali</a><br /><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://album.link/us/i/1729585296\">Three by Four Tet</a><br /><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://album.link/us/i/1749325004\">Migratory by Masayoshi Fujita</a><br /><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://album.link/us/i/1708015501\">TANGK by IDLES</a><br /><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://album.link/us/i/1734691903\">Repertoire by Shane Parish</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As has been the case for the last several years, I probably spent more time listening to instrumental music this year – a lot of classical, ambient, jazz and electronic music. This is mostly because I have a hard time listening to music with lyrics when I’m doing anything that requires my attention, focus or thinking. Much of the music I enjoyed with vocals was enjoyed with my kids. And while they have some of their own preferences, we do enjoy a lot of the same music (thank goodness)! They are my kids after all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Comments are open for this one, so tell me something and let me know what I missed this year. </p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>","author":"bradbarrish","siteTitle":"Brad Barrish","siteHash":"91e49f51884b2947fac16e947ba7e59fe5a24800befb4760d388da1b057f4f23","entryHash":"3e073775899b9ce14674d843a8dadacd58a48cc8a7a3190d5aeb7341601abbc8","category":"Sites"}
