The no-philosophy mess in the Bronx was near-swept by the infidels from California, on their home field no less, so we expect Jankee Estadium to be either haunted in perpetuity or torn down (latter solution preferable) and replaced with something more appropriate, hopefully <i>very</i> far away from Queens, maybe they'd consider moving to California too? Since the Jankees fans only sanction winning, I don't imagine too many would mind if they had to hate them from afar? And now NY baseball is united in our disrespect from the so-called Bronx Bombers, whose bombs were duds this year. Anyway the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2024/10/21/125035.html\">Mets did better</a> against the Dodgers in the NLCS, and their <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani\">star hitter</a> wasn't injured when the lovable Metsies played them. The Mets scored far more runs and of course far more philosophy. And in a desperate attempt to win, when losing was already baked-in, two Janks fans were ejected for trying to <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/world-series-fan-interference-cd45ba4968dbf6f68b0a6c375a286557\">interfere</a> with a Dodger outfielder on a stinking foul ball! I mean if you want to try to steal the game, at least have the good sense to interfere with a home run? Not too smart. Oh well. At least the Janks were humiliated, a bright spot for baseball in the Big Apple.","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"5dbdd796a97a9dcc7686a5d829987d926714fa41180322c7ab01b4b9ea0de1a9","category":"Sites"}
