The TikTok account @snooopyiscool <a href=\"https://archive.ph/sGIcH\">went viral last year for its Snoopy fan edits</a>, which have amassed millions of views, and similar accounts sharing short <em>Peanuts</em> clips featuring the dog have taken off online. </p><p>Soon,<a href=\"https://sourcingjournal.com/denim/denim-trends/snoopy-peanuts-worldwide-charlie-brown-aeropostale-urban-outfitters-kohls-tik-tok-493228/\"> retailers like Urban Outfitters and Kohl's began selling out of Snoopy merch</a>. A CVS exclusive Snoopy plush toy sold out nearly overnight across the country and was listed for 4x to 5x the price on sites like eBay and Mercari. CVS employees <a href=\"https://archive.ph/Fsu6g#selection-5841.106-5841.517\">posted on Reddit about fielding</a> dozens of phone calls daily from young people begging for the Snoopy plushie.¬†</p><p>Snoopy as a character is highly emotional, appreciates the little joys in life, and loves to daydream. It's these aspects of his personality <a href=\"https://x.com/hiimbobbi/status/1833207452021768253\">that resonate</a> most heavily with Gen Z and younger Millennials. ‚ÄúI love Snoopy because of the way he engages with his creative side, his interests, and his curiosity. He‚Äôs a silly roleplaying weirdo but he‚Äôs also charming and chill and a great best friend. He‚Äôs also cute ü•∞,‚Äù one Snoopy fan <a href=\"https://x.com/aka_noie/status/1833296940814958908\">explained</a>. </p><p>Like any viral craze, opportunists quickly swooped in to capitalize on Snoopy-mania. Suddenly, countless Snoopy-themed accounts cropped up online, siphoning off online attention by feeding the Snoopy craze through a steady stream of Snoopy posts.</p><p>Of course it was only a matter of time before it all got political. Since Elon <a href=\"https://slate.com/technology/2024/06/elon-musk-x-twitter-users-likes-private.html\">hid likes in June</a>, it's been harder to read the tea leaves on anonymous account political leanings, but judging from the accounts tagged in @snoopyweekly's post, it's clear that the admin has fallen down a right wing grifter rabbit hole. SnoopyWeekly tagged End Wokeness, Tucker Carlson, Fox News host Greg Gutfeld, multiple members of the Trump family and Hulk Hogan in its announcement.¬†</p><p>The main reason the SnoopyWeekly endorsement reads as so absurd and outrageous is because it's so out of line with the largely young and progressive fandom that has coalesced around Snoopy. </p><p>Other Snoopy accounts have been loosely politically engaged in activism for a while. @DailySnoopys, one of the larger Snoopy accounts on Twitter with over 121,000 followers, for instance, regularly promotes fundraisers for Palestine, Sudan, and other humanitarian crises. These posts have (rightfully!) received almost no backlash.¬†</p><div><figure><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8008cac6-4032-4350-a04c-9c00a9ab79ac_946x572.png\"><div><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8008cac6-4032-4350-a04c-9c00a9ab79ac_946x572.png\" width=\"506\" height=\"305.95348837209303\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8008cac6-4032-4350-a04c-9c00a9ab79ac_946x572.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8008cac6-4032-4350-a04c-9c00a9ab79ac_946x572.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8008cac6-4032-4350-a04c-9c00a9ab79ac_946x572.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8008cac6-4032-4350-a04c-9c00a9ab79ac_946x572.png 1456w\" loading=\"lazy\" /><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>But the emergence of political messaging from anonymous fandom accounts like @snoopyweekly shows how anon theme accounts can build often large, loyal followings by centering on a beloved character or interest, then pivot to political messaging with a built-in platform of engaged followers.</p><p>This particular method of political influence has been used effectively by the right for years. This is why you often see theme accounts about things like ancient architecture, organic living, or nature content suddenly incorporating right-leaning political messaging. But for the entire schtick to work, it has to be subtle. SnoopyWeekly's fatal flaw was that it came out too hard and fast for Trump.</p><p>That said, SnoopyWeekly might have at least a few political allies in the broader Snoopy online fandom. @badsnoopy__, an account with an AI generated Snoopy avatar, openly identifies as conservative. Other Snoopy accounts are pushing <a href=\"https://x.com/SnoopyEthCoin\">dubious Snoopy-themed crypto projects</a>.¬†</p><p>Snoopy IP is controlled by Peanuts Worldwide LLC, which operates as a joint venture between WildBrain (a Canadian media, licensing, and entertainment company), Sony Music Entertainment, and the family of \"Peanuts\" creator Charles Schulz. So far they've kept the brand largely apolitical and don't seem to be cracking down on fan accounts. However, I imagine if some of these accounts become more brazenly political they could risk takedown notices.¬†</p><p>As of Monday, SnoopyWeekly was already sharing <a href=\"https://x.com/Hayley__Harding/status/1843334086506803611\">misinformation about the Michigan voter registration deadline</a>. </p><p>As the author Jamie Loftus <a href=\"https://x.com/jamieloftusHELP/status/1843171932860248409\">put it</a>. ‚ÄúFor those outside the Snoopy community, snoopyweekly recently made an aggressive fascistic push, <a href=\"https://x.com/DailySnoopys\">@dailysnoopys</a> is the way to go.‚Äù </p><div><div><div><p>User Mag is a reader-supported publication.
