(I highly suggest scrolling through the full complaint <a href=\"https://aboutblaw.com/beK4\">here for side by side comparisons</a>.)</p><div><figure><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://news.bloomberglaw.com/ip-law/influencer-trade-dress-suit-risks-flood-of-vibes-based-ip-cases\"><div><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb9486fff-610c-45c4-8069-a0e256f95ded_633x716.png\" width=\"529\" height=\"598.3633491311216\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb9486fff-610c-45c4-8069-a0e256f95ded_633x716.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb9486fff-610c-45c4-8069-a0e256f95ded_633x716.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb9486fff-610c-45c4-8069-a0e256f95ded_633x716.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb9486fff-610c-45c4-8069-a0e256f95ded_633x716.png 1456w\" /><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Gifford reported Sheil to Meta, TikTok, and Amazon, for copyright infringement and sent her a cease-and-desist letter. </p><p>In April, she <a href=\"https://news.bloomberglaw.com/ip-law/influencer-accuses-creator-of-copying-minimalist-grey-aesthetic\">filed a lawsuit</a> under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), which protects copyright holders from online theft. Gifford copyrighted each video on her social media pages so that she could prove ownership of her original content.</p><p>Now, Gifford is seeking up to $150,000 in damages for \"mental anguish” and lost income. She’s also seeking to have Sheil’s content taken down. Gifford argues that Sheil “infringed upon her ‘trade dress,’ which is the overall look and feel that distinguishes a specific brand from others,” <em><a href=\"https://news.bloomberglaw.com/ip-law/influencer-trade-dress-suit-risks-flood-of-vibes-based-ip-cases\">Bloomberg Law</a>,</em> reported.</p><p>The case is a fascinating case study that could have massive downstream effects. Most legal experts I spoke to said that they doubt Gifford will win (a “neutral, beige and cream aesthetic” <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24094338/kyle-chayka-filterworld-algorithmic-recommendation-tiktok-instagram-culture-decoder-interview\">is hardly unique</a>!). But, if she does, it could have lasting ramifications on how influencers protect their content. </p><div><div><div><p>User Mag is a 100% reader-supported publication.

But, most creators only receive them if they’ve directly used someone else’s content (such as a hit pop song or movie clip) without permission. Copying someone’s aesthetic seems like a much lower bar.</p><p>Creators <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeNtNPCTNgo\">recreate each others ideas and videos</a> all the time, but big creators seem to be getting increasingly annoyed with the practice. Top YouTuber MrBeast recently spoke about dealing with copycats in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXEewFEDieU\">an interview</a> with YouTuber Jon Youshaei, saying that other creators had tried to copy his viral hotel video by visiting the same exact hotels, and even replicating his exact language, cadence, text overlays, and video editing style.</p><p>Still, similarities are inevitable online, where niche fashion trends can spread like wildfire and multiple influencers are often contracted to paid to promote the same products. Just this month, <a href=\"https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/68457627/27/gifford-v-sheil/\">a judge ruled</a> that Gifford’s case could move forward. </p><div><figure><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://news.bloomberglaw.com/ip-law/influencer-trade-dress-suit-risks-flood-of-vibes-based-ip-cases\"><div><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd7f265e4-72d8-4656-a8f5-8db19c1d628b_633x434.png\" width=\"457\" height=\"313.3301737756714\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd7f265e4-72d8-4656-a8f5-8db19c1d628b_633x434.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd7f265e4-72d8-4656-a8f5-8db19c1d628b_633x434.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd7f265e4-72d8-4656-a8f5-8db19c1d628b_633x434.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd7f265e4-72d8-4656-a8f5-8db19c1d628b_633x434.png 1456w\" loading=\"lazy\" /><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Mia Sato at <em>The Verge</em> <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/26/24303161/amazon-influencers-lawsuit-copyright-clean-aesthetic-girl-sydney-nicole-gifford-alyssa-sheil\">went to Texas to speak with the influencers</a> involved in the lawsuit.

They’re so good at their jobs that they just bought homes. Sheil has two cats and Gifford, two dogs.

I think you can hold space with lyrics of a song – one you’ve heard hundreds of times – and it can suddenly take on new meaning when you’re a queer person. The Trump administration is targeting LGBTQ+ people via Project 2025. When Cynthia sings ‘I’m through accepting limits,’ there’s power in that. She plays a character who is othered. One who comes to her full power when she is exiled by a charlatan, by a cruel leader. There’s a lot of resonance there right now for anyone who is marginalized. For me, holding space is listening to those lyrics anew and finding solace or inspiration.”</p><p>She said that her friends are trying to get her to launch a merch store since so much counterfeit merch is being sold already, and she hopes the moment might lead to a podcast. <a href=\"https://variety.com/2024/film/news/holding-space-defying-gravity-wicked-interview-meaning-1236223273/\">Read the full interview here</a>. </p><p><a href=\"https://www.usermag.co/subscribe?\"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><h2>More fun stuff</h2><p>Chatbot platform Character.AI <a href=\"https://futurism.com/character-ai-deletes-harry-potter-chatbots\">is mass-removing \"Harry Potter\"-themed AI chatbots from its platform</a> causing a meltdown among fans.</p><p>Is <a href=\"https://www.harpersbazaar.com/preview/draft/fashion/a63019215/shopping-made-to-order-custom-personal/\">custom clothing</a> making a comeback? </p><p>The Cut investigates, <a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/article/what-is-a-khia-pop-music-slang-internet-explainer.html\">what exactly a “khia” is</a> (a popular slang term on stan Twitter).
