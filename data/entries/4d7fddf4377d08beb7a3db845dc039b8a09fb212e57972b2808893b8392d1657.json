The resulting grid of glowing bacteria (which is only simulated in Ramlan’s project) can technically be considered a display of Doom gameplay, though the lack of even grayscale shading makes the resulting image pretty indecipherable, to be honest.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Technicalities aside, that’s still pretty cool.</p>\n\n        \n\n <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Doom\">Doom</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/remix\">remix</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/video\">video</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/video%20games\">video games</a></p>\n\n <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/02/doom-runs-on-e-coli-bacteria-now\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"4d7fddf4377d08beb7a3db845dc039b8a09fb212e57972b2808893b8392d1657","category":"default"}
