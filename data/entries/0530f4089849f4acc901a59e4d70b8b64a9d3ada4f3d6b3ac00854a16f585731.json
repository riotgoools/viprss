In <a href=\"https://craigmod.com/roden/091/\">the latest issue of his Roden newsletter</a>, he explains why he likes it so much:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>Once you hold a Palma, you realize that for most situations it’s an ideal reading container. On the train? In line? In the waiting room at the doctor’s office? I’ve carried my Palma with me every day for the past three or so months with the goal of reaching for it rather than my iPhone. I call it the Gentle Librarian. Soft screen, clean interface, no SIM card and so mostly no internet (it loads up with new articles while at home on Wi-Fi; I can always tether to my phone to update or add something new to read on the go), a refresh rate that is plausible enough on which to watch movies (!! hypnotizing, actually, like watching a magic trick, like what Victorians may have imagined “computer screens” to look like) but not really responsive enough to seduce you into installing social media apps. There’s a lot of friction in this little bugger, and it turns out a bit of friction is a good friend of the kind of reading we love.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Hmm. Hmm! Like Mod, I’m frustrated with Amazon’s lack of vision and activity on the ereader front and lament the time I spend on my Casino Rectangle / <a href=\"https://www.threads.net/@craigmod/post/C6aLgHJyDWG\">Dingdong Casino of Hell</a>. Maybe I’ll try the Palma out…</p>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Amazon\">Amazon</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/books\">books</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/BOOX\">BOOX</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Craig%20Mod\">Craig Mod</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Kindle\">Kindle</a></p>\n\n         <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/05/the-gentle-librarian\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"0530f4089849f4acc901a59e4d70b8b64a9d3ada4f3d6b3ac00854a16f585731","category":"default"}
