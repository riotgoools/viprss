Now theyâ€™ve made a second miniseries that covers the events of the third book, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1250182492/ref=nosim/0sil8\">The Mirror and the Light</a>. Hereâ€™s a trailer and synopsis:</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<blockquote><p>The TV sequel picks up in May 1536 after the beheading of Anne Boleyn and follows the last four years of Thomas Cromwellâ€™s life, completing his journey from self-made man to the most feared and influential figure of his time. These are years when Henryâ€™s regime is severely tested by religious rebellion at home, traitors plotting abroad and the threat of invasion. Cromwell must deftly navigate the moral complexities that accompany the exercise of power in this bloody time; heâ€™s caught between his desire to do whatâ€™s right and his instinct to survive. The question is: how long can anyone survive under Henryâ€™s brutally mercurial gaze?</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Wolf Hall: The Mirror and the Light premieres in the UK on BBC One on Nov 10 but Americans have to wait until March 23, 2025 to watch it on PBS.</p>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/books\">books</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Damian%20Lewis\">Damian Lewis</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Hilary%20Mantel\">Hilary Mantel</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Mark%20Rylance\">Mark Rylance</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/trailers\">trailers</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/TV\">TV</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/video\">video</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Wolf%20Hall\">Wolf Hall</a></p>\n\n         <p>ðŸ’¬ <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/11/wolf-hall-the-mirror-and-the-light\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> â†’</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"b774c8bce187472bcb9d0e97f22853e03d43adeb732d7fccbaf3c3dc37041b25","category":"Sites"}
