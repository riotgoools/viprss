{"title":"Post(news) Script","link":"https://om.co/2024/04/22/postnews-script/","date":1713797804000,"content":"<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://post.news/\">Post.News</a>, a Twitter-like news-first social network, is shutting down. It is not surprising. It lacked dynamism and excitement, even as an early adopter and a former media professional. Given the overwhelming emphasis they put on establishment media, I am not surprised. The last time I visited <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://post.news/\">Post.News</a> was to read founder Noah Bardin’s post. “Our service is not growing fast enough to become a real business or a significant platform,” he noted. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is not just <a href=\"http://post.news/\" target=\"_blank\">Post.News</a>. Many Twitter-like social platforms such as Mastodon, Blue Sky, and Threads got out of the gates fast but eventually slowed down. When Threads launched, <a href=\"https://om.co/2023/07/11/zuck-threads-the-needle-pricks-musk/\" target=\"_blank\">I pointed out,</a> “The days of getting a social network to grow by importing an address book are gone — instead, it is about using, reusing, and using the social graph again to launch new products.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Threads seems to be the only one with staying power because it is being bootstrapped by Instagram’s social graph. Of the lot, it would be interesting to see how much bigger it can get — it has 130 million users — and how much activity it can generate. But is it a full-time Twitter replacement? I don’t think so. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trying to replace Twitter can only take you so far. You need to stand out and give people a reason to keep coming back. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://om.co/2024/04/15/im-airchatting/\">Something like AirChat</a> is an exciting new way to socialize. Bottom line — social is going through its cable-like <em>nichefication</em> phase. The audience for each new flavor of Twitter-like (or any social) network is only so much. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bardin decided it was time to cut his losses and move on! </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>April 22, 2024, San Francisco</em></p>","author":"Om Malik","siteTitle":"Om Malik","siteHash":"56aa7c22de1a9e5680d03082a2a13db78fe214c96b8119e8d54042cbf2d355ae","entryHash":"e72541cb4913d2a34f1d865df68a0ed96071a731236d6324b9e132cfe89be73b","category":"default"}
