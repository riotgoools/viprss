I never met Jake in person but we were pen pals? email pals? blog friends? for well over a decade. We shared an interest in speeding up drug research and development, <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://jakeseliger.com/2023/07/22/i-am-dying-of-squamous-cell-carcinoma-and-the-treatments-that-might-save-me-are-just-out-of-reach/\">including FDA deregulation</a>, an interest which long preceded Jake’s cancer diagnosis. But mostly I thought he was a great writer and human being. His essays were always thoughtful and without pretense or sentimentality.</p>\r\n<p>Jake’s wife, Bess Stillman is now 7 months pregnant with their daughter. Bess is an ER physician and a remarkable woman. Here is an interview with her on the infuriating difficulty of <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/sorting-through-498-000-clinical-trials/id1548137490?i=1000659331396\">getting a patient enrolled in a clinical trial in the United States</a>. Here is <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://themoth.org/storytellers/bess-stillman\">How to Say It</a>, her gripping telling on the Moth Radio hour of how she tells people their loved ones have died. If you wonder about the title of this post, that is why. Do read <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://bessstillman.substack.com/p/how-to-let-go-one-life-ends-while\">How to Let Go</a> on her last days with Jake. Sigh.</p>\r\n<p>Here is <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://jakeseliger.com/2023/07/23/how-do-we-evaluate-our-lives-at-the-end-what-counts-what-matters/\">Jake</a>:</p>\r\n<blockquote><p>One virtue of a prolonged end is that I feel like I’ve said everything I have to say. I don’ t know that I have a favorite, but I’m fond of “<a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://jakeseliger.com/2023/08/21/i-know-what-happens-to-me-after-i-die-but-what-about-those-left-behind/\">I know what happens to me after I die, but what about those left behind?</a>” Same with “<a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://jakeseliger.com/2023/07/23/how-do-we-evaluate-our-lives-at-the-end-what-counts-what-matters/\">How do we evaluate our lives, at the end? What counts, what matters?</a>” I’m tempted to keep citing others, but if you scroll down into the archives you will find them. I meant to turn these essays into a memoir, but that is a project never to be completed by me. Bess assures me that she’s going to complete the project and do her best to get it published. We’ve created so much together in the process of building our life, and Bess says that doesn’t need to stop just because I’m not physically here, and that putting both our baby and our book into the world gives her immediate future the purpose that she’ll badly need.</p>\r\n<p>Though having my life cut short by cancer is horrible, I’ve still in many ways been lucky. Most people never find the person who completes them, I think, and I have. I’ve been helped so much. Numerous oncologists have gone above and beyond. Many people, friends and strangers, have asked if there is anything they can do to help. The #1 thing is to support Bess and our soon-to-be-born daughter, Athena, whatever “support” may mean—the most obvious way is <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-the-fight-against-cancer-with-jake-s\">the Go Fund Me</a>, as any remaining funds will go to Athena. I wish she could grow up with her father, but that is not an option.
