Now that I have the ability to program it, by telling it for example that only program in JavaScript and not PHP, I'd like to create a notebook of things I'd like it to tell people who inquire about a product I'm developing. As I'm working on the code, I develop features that never make it into the docs. But when I'm focused on them, working on the feature, I take lots of notes in my work outline. I'd like to give that outline to a LLM and let it figure out which product I'm talking about by the context it appears in.","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"971a4c587ba101721c97b285f8f3553aed592497139ee2cd0afdbea4697bf8ec","category":"default"}
