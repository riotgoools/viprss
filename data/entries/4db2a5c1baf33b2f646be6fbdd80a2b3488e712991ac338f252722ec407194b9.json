People aren’t attracted to the platform, they’re repelled away from X and looking for anywhere else. In fact, I’d argue the only identity Bluesky has right now is a place of refuge for people who thrived on older declining social platforms and had to move on, but don’t like any of the newer ones.</p><p>That applies to a lot of people from a lot of places. To get a sense of how many, just look at the most popular accounts. After the official Bluesky account, you have <span><a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/neilhimself.neilgaiman.com?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=bluesky-s-biggest-selling-points-are-things-it-doesn-t-do\" target=\"_blank\">Neil Gaiman</a></span>, who’s already been the de facto face of <span><a href=\"https://neil-gaiman.tumblr.com/?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=bluesky-s-biggest-selling-points-are-things-it-doesn-t-do\" target=\"_blank\">Tumblr</a></span> for years. Next you have the <i><span><a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/washingtonpost.com?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=bluesky-s-biggest-selling-points-are-things-it-doesn-t-do\" target=\"_blank\">Washington Post</a></span></i> and <i><span><a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/nytimes.com?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=bluesky-s-biggest-selling-points-are-things-it-doesn-t-do\" target=\"_blank\">New York Times</a></span></i>, representing all the news junkies who have been forsaken by X.

Dril’s network of shitposters originally came to Twitter in the early 2010s, migrating from Something Awful, so they’ve done this dance before. And after him, you have <span><a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/ngntrtr.bsky.social?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=bluesky-s-biggest-selling-points-are-things-it-doesn-t-do\" target=\"_blank\">Nagano</a></span>, a manga artist who draws cute bears.

Instead, most of Bluesky’s selling points are things it doesn’t do. No algorithmic feeds, no DMs, no videos, no hashtags. Obviously people don’t want the suffocating engagement bait that you get on X, but when there’s so little replacing it, the sales pitch starts to feel like a retirement home brochure. Is this really what people want, a cozy set of <span><a href=\"https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/06/18/florida-senior-citizens-vote-election-2018-218758/?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=bluesky-s-biggest-selling-points-are-things-it-doesn-t-do\" target=\"_blank\">Villages</a></span> walled off from the hurly-burly of actually modern posting?</p><p>Frankly, that’s exactly what I personally want.

She didn’t read it, because why would she, and all she’s posted on Bluesky for months are screenshots from her Letterboxd page, because why wouldn’t she?</p><p>And yet, I can’t ignore the creeping realization that every other Twitter substitute is even less cool. Threads’ aggressive marketing by Meta has successfully created “text-based Instagram”.  Sure, a bunch of celebrities and companies joined after getting the same nagging messages we all did, but as a platform all they’re offering may as well be “G-rated Pornhub”. On the less corporate end, Mastodon and its whole wooly family is an option the same way setting your phone’s keyboard to <span><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/14/23404125/ios-16-dvorak-keyboard-support?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=bluesky-s-biggest-selling-points-are-things-it-doesn-t-do\" target=\"_blank\">Dvorak</a></span> is an option — and will be exciting to the exact same people. What else is there? <span><a href=\"https://time.com/6292622/spill-app-twitter-alternative/?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=bluesky-s-biggest-selling-points-are-things-it-doesn-t-do\" target=\"_blank\">Spill</a></span>? <span><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/03/post-a-twitter-alternative-that-pays-publishers-via-microtransactions-launches-public-beta/?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=bluesky-s-biggest-selling-points-are-things-it-doesn-t-do\" target=\"_blank\">Post dot News</a></span>? Hold me, I might faint.</p><p>To be clear, I can easily imagine Bluesky cultivating its current audience of uprooted Tweeters and staying stable for a long time. What I can’t imagine is the platform ever being cool  — i.e. enjoyed by young and/or marginalized people coming to it because what it actually does — without alienating that audience and sending them packing all over again.</p><hr /><p><i>The following is a paid ad.

You’ve definitely seen it before. It just says, “god i wish that were me”. And it’s pretty funny on its own.</p><div><img src=\"https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/1d48d3d2-8d17-45d4-827b-ad575c8e2a47/Screenshot_2024-02-14_at_9.39.45_AM.png?t=1707899997\" /><div><span><p>(DeviantArt/BigJB21)</p></span></div></div><p>What you might not know, however, is that the comment <a href=\"https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/god-i-wish-that-were-me?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=bluesky-s-biggest-selling-points-are-things-it-doesn-t-do\" target=\"_blank\">was originally posted</a> underneath a piece of 3D fetish art depicting a giant woman cradling a tiny man in a diaper and that BigJB21 was pretty active adult diaper enthusiast on DeviantArt. Which makes the comment, of course, much funnier.</p><p>Anyways, I was not very familiar with Elon Musk’s fans before he bought Twitter. I knew they were sort of dorky, but over the last few years, I have begun to realize that many of them seem to feel the same way about Musk that BigJB21 felt about that giant 3D woman.

I mean, it’s never been easy — I still remember where I was when I learned how Nielsen Ratings were collected — but it’s even harder now. And it’s definitely a lot harder than it was in 2015 when Jon Stewart left <i>The Daily Show</i>.</p><p>According to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TVMoJoe/status/1757529347815248315?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=bluesky-s-biggest-selling-points-are-things-it-doesn-t-do\" target=\"_blank\">TVMoJoe</a> and The <i>Wall Street Journal</i>’s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JBFlint/status/1757516201855762449?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=bluesky-s-biggest-selling-points-are-things-it-doesn-t-do\" target=\"_blank\">Joe Flint</a>, Stewart’s return to the desk this week had 930,000 average viewers, with additional same-day viewers pushing it to around 1.85 million. Which was the show’s best ratings <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TVMoJoe/status/1757529626606452812?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=bluesky-s-biggest-selling-points-are-things-it-doesn-t-do\" target=\"_blank\">since 2018</a>. Though, still not great for, you know, the continued existence of TV as a medium.</p><p>Over on YouTube, Stewart’s main segment has been watched a respectable 4.4 million times. Which is good for a late night show, but around what former <i>Daily Show</i> host John Oliver does on average. Stewart also angered a lot of libs, which is always a nice little treat.</p><p>Stewart’s return is especially interesting from a platform perspective because post-<i>Daily Show</i>, he never really embraced the Internet the way other talk show hosts did, like the aforementioned Oliver, Conan O’Brien, or even Trever Noah, with his unscripted Facebook riff videos. </p><p>But most of those hosts, and their various digital walkabouts, weren’t really try to reinvent the production and distribution of video content as much they were trying to shake off the restrictions of television and make something that fit their sensibilities better. The flip side of this would be Jimmy Fallon’s 2010s obsession with glitzy brand safe viral games that have aged quite poorly. </p><p>But, as Stewart will tell you, he’s good at one thing and that one thing is sitting behind that desk. Which makes me actually pretty optimistic. As long as he focuses on that he’ll keep pulling in eyeballs, wherever they may live now.</p><hr /><h2>Finally, Some Good Media News</h2><p><i>Slate</i> had its best year ever <a href=\"https://www.semafor.com/article/02/11/2024/slate-reports-best-year?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=bluesky-s-biggest-selling-points-are-things-it-doesn-t-do\" target=\"_blank\">last year</a>. <i>404 Media</i> <a href=\"https://www.niemanlab.org/2024/02/six-months-in-journalist-owned-tech-publication-404-media-is-profitable/?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=bluesky-s-biggest-selling-points-are-things-it-doesn-t-do\" target=\"_blank\">is profitable</a>. For <i>Slate</i>, their focus on their website (hell yeah) and chat podcasts (hell YEAH) were what helped them the most. And <i>404 </i>is run as a co-op, with the four owners paying themselves equally and DIYing most of the site’s operation, including the art for stories and merch distro.</p><p>The thing that really gets me revved up and my heart racing when I read about both of these sites’ success is that almost of all of it flies in the face of what was popular wisdom back in the viral media days. The amount of meetings I’ve sat in about how direct traffic doesn’t matter compared to social traffic or that chat podcasts can’t support ads or that the art that accompanies a story can’t be weird and quirky or that reporters don’t actually know what people want to read. The list goes on and on.<i> </i></p><p>The media industry isn’t quite ready to reckon with how useless the last 15 years of chasing audience-less Facebook and Google traffic has been, but I do think the tide is beginning to turn. The advertising industry might still be hooked on lowest common denominator Number Go Up metrics, but once enough media outlets change course, I think that’ll go next.</p><hr /><h2>These X Accounts Are Running Ads With AI Copy To Do… Something </h2><blockquote><p></p><p>Love to get an ad for, as far as I can tell, the concept of a hamburger.</p><p></p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/yacobg42/status/1757395835141099964?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=bluesky-s-biggest-selling-points-are-things-it-doesn-t-do\"><p> — Jacob Geller (@yacobg42) <br /> Feb 13, 2024 </p></a></blockquote><p>In the replies, there’s a bunch of other examples of verified accounts posting random likely-AI-generated descriptions of food.
