NASA: <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/image-article/what-solar-prominence/\">What is a solar prominence?</a></p>\n\n<blockquote><p>A solar prominence (also known as a filament when viewed against the solar disk) is a large, bright feature extending outward from the Sun’s surface. Prominences are anchored to the Sun’s surface in the photosphere, and extend outwards into the Sun’s hot outer atmosphere, called the corona. A prominence forms over timescales of about a day, and stable prominences may persist in the corona for several months, looping hundreds of thousands of miles into space. Scientists are still researching how and why prominences are formed.</p>\n\n<p>The red-glowing looped material is plasma, a hot gas comprised of electrically charged hydrogen and helium. The prominence plasma flows along a tangled and twisted structure of magnetic fields generated by the sun’s internal dynamo. An erupting prominence occurs when such a structure becomes unstable and bursts outward, releasing the plasma.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>A timelapse video of totality from Scientific American:</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>Thomas Fuchs <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/thomasfuchs.at/post/3kpnhdz6t6b22\">caught some sunspots through his telescope during the partial eclipse</a>. (We saw these through our ‘scope as well.)</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/solar-eclipse-2024-04.jpg\" srcset=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=500,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/solar-eclipse-2024-04.jpg 500w, /cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/solar-eclipse-2024-04.jpg 1200w\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1300\" height=\"1292\" alt=\"Solar Eclipse 2024 04\" /></p>\n\n<p>Quick sunspot explainer interlude. NASA: <a href=\"https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/SolarMax/solarmax_2.php\">What exactly is a sunspot?</a></p>\n\n<blockquote><p>A sunspot is simply a region on the surface of the sun-called the photosphere-that is temporarily cool and dark compared to surrounding regions. Solar measurements reveal that the average surface temperature of the sun is 6000° Celsius and that sunspots are about 1500° Celsius cooler than the area surrounding them (still very hot), and can last anywhere from a few hours to a few months. Sunspots expand and contract as they move across the surface of the sun and can be as large as 80,000 km in diameter.</p>\n\n<p>Sunspots are magnetic regions on the sun with magnetic field strengths thousands of times stronger than the Earth’s magnetic field, and often appear in pairs that are aligned in an east-west direction. One set will have a positive or north magnetic field while the other set will have a negative or south magnetic field. The field is strongest in the darker parts of the sunspots — called the umbra. The field is weaker and more horizontal in the lighter part-the penumbra. Overall, sunspots have a magnetic field that is about 1000 times stronger than the surrounding photosphere.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/thestampcurse/\">This Instagram account</a> has a lovingly assembled collection of solar eclipse stamps from around the world (Aruba, Bhutan, Chile, Romania, Kenya, and even North Korea).</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/solar-eclipse-2024-05.jpg\" srcset=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=500,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/solar-eclipse-2024-05.jpg 500w, /cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/solar-eclipse-2024-05.jpg 1200w\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1300\" height=\"1300\" alt=\"Solar Eclipse 2024 05\" /></p>\n\n<p>A NY Times timelapse: <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/04/08/science/eclipse-satellite.html?unlocked_article_code=1.jE0.tLz-.0wvahLH-ifmZ\">See the Total Solar Eclipse’s Shadow From Space</a> (assembled from NASA and NOAA satellite imagery).</p>\n\n<p>Great solar prominences on <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/comraderobot.bsky.social/post/3kpnhgxclq52g\">this shot from Notorious RBMK</a>.

And I’m not sure I entirely trust the veracity of <a href=\"https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=now%207-d&amp;geo=US&amp;q=why%20do%20my%20eyes%20hurt&amp;hl=en-US\">the trending search results for “why do my eyes hurt”</a> but here it is anyway.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.space.com/37627-total-solar-eclipse-earth-moon-alignment-future.html\">Earth Will Have Its Last Total Solar Eclipse in About 600 Million Years</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>Total solar eclipses occur because the moon and the sun have the same apparent size in Earth’s sky — the sun is about 400 times wider than the moon, but the moon is about 400 times closer.</p>\n\n<p>But the moon is slowly moving away from Earth by about 1-1/2 inches (4 centimeters) per year, according to the NASA statement. As a result, total solar eclipses will cease to exist in the very distant future, because the apparent size of the moon in Earth’s sky will be too small to cover the sun completely.</p>\n\n<p>“Over time, the number and frequency of total solar eclipses will decrease,” Vondrak said in the statement. “About 600 million years from now, Earth will experience the beauty and drama of a total solar eclipse for the last time.”</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>If you want to get a headstart on trip planning, <a href=\"https://eclipsophile.com/tse2026/\">the next eclipse is going to be in Greenland, Iceland, and Spain on August 12, 2026</a>.
