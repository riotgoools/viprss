The phrase that grabbed me is:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>Pedestrians, cyclists, and vehicles can all coexist without conflict, but only if theyâ€™re all going the same slow speed. This advances the principles of shared streets.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>This is related to <a href=\"https://blogs.cornell.edu/info2040/2021/09/22/traffic-in-cities-the-downs-thomson-paradox/\">the Downs-Thomson paradox</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>In simple terms, the Downs-Thomson paradox claims that traffic will increase without limit until the option of public transport (or any other form of transport) becomes faster than the equivalent trip by car. It draws the conclusion that people do not care whether they drive, walk, bike, or take the bus to any location â€” they just want to get from A to B in the fastest and most convenient way possible.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>(via <a href=\"https://xoxo.zone/@marcprecipice\">@marcprecipice</a>)</p>\n\n <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Adam%20Yates\">Adam Yates</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/cities\">cities</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/traffic\">traffic</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/video\">video</a></p>\n\n <p>ðŸ’¬ <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/03/how-the-dutch-solved-street-design\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> â†’</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"7b134b48c88473581f4416c8597fdbb1ce0b51f808460cad3bfa5bda07730458","category":"default"}
