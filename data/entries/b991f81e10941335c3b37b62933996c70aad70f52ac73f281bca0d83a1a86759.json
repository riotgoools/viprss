Or rather, an “incessant focus on franchises” in the words of former Disney CFO Jay Rasulo.</p>\n\n<p>“Everything we do is about brands and franchises,” Rasulo told a group of financial analysts last September. “Ten years ago we were more like other media companies, more broad-based, big movie slate, 20 something pictures, some franchise, some not franchise. If you look at our slate strategy now, our television strategy, almost every aspect of the company, we are oriented around brands and franchises.”</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Franchises are well suited to extend across multiple parts of a big business like Disney, particularly because it’s a repeating virtuous cycle: movies drive merchandise sales and theme park visits, which in turn drives interest for sequels and spin-offs, rinse, repeat, reboot.</p>\n\n<p>I wonder if more tech companies could be using this strategy more effectively. Apple does pretty well; their various hardware (iPhone, iPad, Mac), software (iOS, OS X), and services (iCloud, App Store, iTunes Store) work together effectively. Microsoft rode Office &amp; Windows for quite awhile. Google seems a bit more all over the place — for instance, it’s unclear how their self-driving car helps their search business and Google+ largely failed to connect various offerings. Facebook seems to be headed in the right direction. Twitter? Not so much, but we’ll see how they do with new leadership. Or old leadership…I discovered Walt’s chart <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jack/status/613917216715710464\">via interim Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey</a>.</p>\n\n         <p><em>[This is a vintage post originally from Jun 2015.]</em></p>\n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Apple\">Apple</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Bob%20Iger\">Bob Iger</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/business\">business</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Disney\">Disney</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Facebook\">Facebook</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Google\">Google</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Jack%20Dorsey\">Jack Dorsey</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Microsoft\">Microsoft</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/timeless%20posts\">timeless posts</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Todd%20Zenger\">Todd Zenger</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Twitter\">Twitter</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Walt%20Disney\">Walt Disney</a></p>\n\n        \n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"b991f81e10941335c3b37b62933996c70aad70f52ac73f281bca0d83a1a86759","category":"Sites"}
