Let’s have it.</p>\r\n<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>First, across countries, it’s mostly the Anglosphere and the Nordic countries, which are more or less part of the Anglosphere. Most of the world is immune to this, and smartphones for them seem fine. Why isn’t it just that a negative mood came upon the Anglosphere for reasons we mostly don’t understand, and it didn’t come upon most of the rest of the world? If we’re differentiating my hypothesis from yours, doesn’t that favor my view?</p>\r\n<p><strong>HAIDT: </strong>Well, once you look into the connections and the timing, I would say no. I think I see what you’re saying now, but I think your view would say, “Just for some reason we don’t know, things changed around 2012.” Whereas I’m going to say, “Okay, things changed around 2012 in all these countries. We see it in the mental illness rates, <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/11/facebooks-dangerous-experiment-teen-girls/620767/\" target=\"_blank\">especially of the girls</a>.” I’m going to say it’s not just some mood thing. It’s like (a), why is it especially the girls? (b) —</p>\r\n<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>They’re more mimetic, right?</p>\r\n<p><strong>HAIDT: </strong>Yes, that’s true.</p>\r\n<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Girls are more mimetic in general.</p>\r\n<p><strong>HAIDT: </strong>That’s right. That’s part of it. You’re right, that’s part of it. They’re just much more open to connection. They’re more influenced. They’re more subject to contagion. That is a big part of it, you’re right. What <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://zach-rausch.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Zach Rausch</a> and I have found — he’s my lead researcher at the <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.afterbabel.com/\" target=\"_blank\">After Babel Substack</a>. I hope people will sign up. It’s free. We’ve been putting out tons of research. Zach has really tracked down what happened internationally, and I can lay it out.</p>\r\n<p>Now I know the answer. I didn’t know it two months ago. The answer is, within countries, as I said, it’s the people who are conservative and religious who are protected, and the others, the kids get washed out to sea. Psychologically, they feel their life has no meaning. They get more depressed. Zach has looked across countries, and what you find in Europe is that, overall, the kids are getting a little worse off psychologically.</p>\r\n<p>But that hides the fact that in Eastern Europe, which is getting more religious, the kids are actually healthier now than they were 10 years ago, 15 years ago. Whereas in Catholic Europe, they’re a little worse, and in Protestant Europe, they’re <em>much</em> worse.</p>\r\n<p>It doesn’t seem to me like, oh, New Zealand and Iceland were talking to each other, and the kids were sharing memes. It’s rather, everyone in the developed world, even in Eastern Europe, everyone — their kids are on phones, but the penetration, the intensity, was faster in the richest countries, the Anglos and the Scandinavians. That’s where people had the most independence and individualism, which was pretty conducive to happiness before the smartphone. But it now meant that these are the kids who get washed away when you get that rapid conversion to the phone-based childhood around 2012. What’s wrong with that explanation?</p>\r\n<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Old Americans also seem grumpier to me. Maybe that’s cable TV, but it’s not that they’re on their phones all the time. And you know all these studies. If you try to assess what percentage of the variation in happiness of young people is caused by smartphone usage — <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://sabinehossenfelder.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Sabine Hossenfelder</a> had a recent video on this — those numbers are very, very, very small. That’s another measurement that seems to discriminate in favor of my theory, exogenous mood shifts, rather than your theory. Why not?</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Very interesting throughout, recommended.  And do not forget that Jon’s argument is outlined in detail in his new book, titled <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.amazon.com/Anxious-Generation-Rewiring-Childhood-Epidemic/dp/0593655036/ref=sr_1_1?crid=17D6D4RIN8AMY&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.pLA6Rb-vSM6-wdPqDulw2K5ILrcN6OGLECqt7jVfs_Z-HiEEBoplHCA3UsfDNMnOxbuHlPfFic31FBkg4axX6_dZG9wxT4GwkXCJzZxX2tZwHF1gF1md8HQyMn-PxK3GOOFUhzVX43W3V6YB9fr7bsU_et1Pkk0QS7g0WT55cipZLGAaU6XQyqerNoq3Emo0nDxlcJ01rJG77GFJYufGogwiLKSoOMA8n2R_6YC-rHk.2oIjOOSDvyyw9gJYJ8UFVkEkYElVeqv5_cHR1v_a3VU&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=jon+haidt&amp;qid=1712159184&amp;sprefix=jon+haidt%2Caps%2C89&amp;sr=8-1\" target=\"_blank\">The Anxious Generation: How the Great Rewiring of Childhood is Causing an Epidemic of Mental Illness</a>.</p>\r\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/04/my-contentious-conversation-with-jonathan-haidt.html\">My contentious Conversation with Jonathan Haidt</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com\">Marginal REVOLUTION</a>.</p>\r\n<img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/874992314/0/marginalrevolution\" />\r\n<div><a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/874992314/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/874992314/marginalrevolution,\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/874992314/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/x.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/874992314/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/874992314/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/04/my-contentious-conversation-with-jonathan-haidt.html#comments\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/comments20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/04/my-contentious-conversation-with-jonathan-haidt.html/feed\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/commentsrss20.png\" /></a> \r\n<div><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/04/my-contentious-conversation-with-jonathan-haidt.html#comments\"><h3>Comments</h3></a><ul><li><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/04/my-contentious-conversation-with-jonathan-haidt.html#comment-160739595\">In reply to John Mansfield.
