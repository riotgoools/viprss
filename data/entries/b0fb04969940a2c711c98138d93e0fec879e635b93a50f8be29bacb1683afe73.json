If the Knicks win, they go on to the next round vs the Celtics, starting on Tuesday. If they lose, we relax for four months or so, when it <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024%E2%80%9325_NBA_season\">starts all over again</a>. With love for the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj_kK1j3CV0&amp;t=315s\">heart of gold</a> team. Either way we win, imho. I know you're not supposed to feel that way, but that's how I feel right now. During the game, if we're losing, based on recent experience I won't like that so much. <span>ðŸ˜„</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"b0fb04969940a2c711c98138d93e0fec879e635b93a50f8be29bacb1683afe73","category":"default"}
