Nothing serious, but of all the “life advice” posts I’ve read, this is the one that’s changed my own life the most. Anyone else have something from an advice list that really made it into their brains/lives?</p>\n\n<p>The closest thing to a life advice aphorism <em>I’ve</em> ever come up with is maybe too gross to write down. And it’s running-themed, so it could be too specific. But maybe if I share it here, I will exorcise it from my brain: Sometimes you’re so worried about pooping your pants that you don’t realize you’ve already pooped your pants. </p>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/advice\">advice</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/David%20Brooks\">David Brooks</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Kevin%20Kelly\">Kevin Kelly</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/take%20two%20trips\">take two trips</a></p>\n\n         <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/05/take-two-trips\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Edith Zimmerman","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"efcf6e588c696b100d2925983ef36e002bd1bbaa6c11c4e8866bbd2e318cd0ef","category":"default"}
