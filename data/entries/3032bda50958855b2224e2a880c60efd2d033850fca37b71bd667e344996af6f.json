We think the Democrats are the opposite, they are inclusive, everyone is welcome there. But that's not true. This <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/11/01/nx-s1-5154873/what-explains-the-big-gender-gap-between-supporters-of-trump-and-harris\">NPR piece</a> touches on it, gingerly, because it's the third rail in non-Republican politics. Because it's one of the divisions that's maintained by people who are mostly Democrats. If you want to know if you're part of the problem, measure your own feelings when you find out what it's about. And then listen, carefully to the words. It might be hard to hear because I think most people who do this don't think they do, or they're justified in doing it. They don't want to look here. But the pragmatic reason to focus on this is that in future elections, assuming we have them, if we can make an effort to not do this, we could get enough Republican votes to switch to make real change possible. They might even become our most vocal supporters. Winning in politics is done by focusing on common interests over division.","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"3032bda50958855b2224e2a880c60efd2d033850fca37b71bd667e344996af6f","category":"Sites"}
