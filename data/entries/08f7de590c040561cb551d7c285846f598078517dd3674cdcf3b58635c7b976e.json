One of the changes I quietly made to the site with <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/03/kottkeorg-redesigns-with-2024-vibes\">the recent redesign</a> is enabling members to set their own price on memberships. It’s been 7 and a half years since <a href=\"https://kottke.org/members\">the membership program</a> launched, and I’ve thought about raising prices over the years just to keep pace with inflation, but it never seemed like the right way to go.</p>\n\n<p>So I’ve put that capability in your hands. Now you can voluntarily raise prices if you’d like — here’s how it works. The price of each membership tier is now a base price that can be added on to (e.g. for the Patron tier, $30 is the minimum but you can increase that to $35 or even $130 if you’d like). For current members, your chosen new price will go into effect on your next renewal date.</p>\n\n<p>If that’s something you’d be interested in doing and are currently a member, you can <a href=\"https://kottke.memberful.com/account/subscriptions\">go to the subscriptions view</a> and click on “change price”. The whole thing takes about 15 seconds (perhaps a bit longer if you need to log in). For new members, you can simply choose the price you want when you enter your payment information <a href=\"https://kottke.org/members\">during the signup process</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Ok, that wasn’t too bad. Now back to our regularly scheduled links from the internet. <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/03/what-do-the-different-emoji-hearts-mean\">💞</a></p>\n\n <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/kottke.org\">kottke.org</a></p>\n\n <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/03/membership-pricing\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"08f7de590c040561cb551d7c285846f598078517dd3674cdcf3b58635c7b976e","category":"default"}
