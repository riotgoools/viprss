{"title":"Welcome to Choppke&#8217;s, Your Wich Is My Command","link":"https://kottke.org/24/03/welcome-to-choppkes","date":1710969289000,"content":"\n        <p>A couple of years ago, frustrated by a takeout Italian sandwich with unevenly distributed fillings, I had a wonderful, life-changing idea: chopped sandwiches. It’s like what you get at those chopped salad places but instead of chopping up all the ingredients and putting them into a bowl, you put them between two slices of bread or in a hoagie roll or whatever. That way, you get all of the elements of the sandwich — cheese, tomato, lettuce, dressing/mayo, onion, whatever — in every single bite. Yum.</p>\n\n<p>Chopwiches already exist — tuna salad, Philly cheesesteaks, chicken salad, egg salad — and they’re amazing because you get all of their deliciousness in every bite. I just wanted to extend that enjoyment to many other types of sandwich: banh mi, BLT, Italian sub, gyro, turkey club, and even the humble ham and cheese. Great idea, right? I wanted to open a chopped sandwich restaurant and change the world.</p>\n\n<p>Then I made a mistake: I told people about my idea. And every single one of them laughed at me. To my face! My friends, my kids, everyone. It was a heartbreaking moment but as an entrepreneur, I knew I had to persist and follow my dream. Like Wayne Gretzky said: “First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win.” And I was going to <em>win</em>.</p>\n\n<p>But the whole thing became a joke for awhile and I had to play along, biding my time. My friend Caroline came up with a name: Choppke’s. We brainstormed slogans and things the sandwich artists could say to patrons:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Choppke’s. You’ll Love It to Bits.</li>\n<li>Welcome to Choppke’s, your wich is my command.</li>\n<li>As you wich. [In response to any customer query.]</li>\n<li>Welcome to Choppke’s! What can I get chopping for you today?</li></ul>\n\n<p>I asked ChatGPT to come up with a logo; this was my favorite one:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/choppkes-01.jpg\" srcset=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=500,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/choppkes-01.jpg 500w, /cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/choppkes-01.jpg 1200w\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" alt=\"a logo for Choppke's\" /></p>\n\n<p>When (not if!) Choppke’s gets huge, there’s gonna be a corporate jet, so I wanted to see what that was going to look like:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/choppkes-02.jpg\" srcset=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=500,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/choppkes-02.jpg 500w, /cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/choppkes-02.jpg 1200w\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"572\" alt=\"a large jet airplane with a Choppke's logo on it\" /></p>\n\n<p>Caroline got me a custom-made hat for my birthday (actual hat and actual dopey human wearing it, not AI-generated):</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/choppkes-03.jpg\" srcset=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=500,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/choppkes-03.jpg 500w, /cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/choppkes-03.jpg 1200w\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1067\" alt=\"Jason wearing a Choppke's hat\" /></p>\n\n<p>Ever so slowly, I was winning her over, despite every fiber of her being telling her that a chopped sandwich restaurant was the stupidest idea she’d ever heard and causing her to question the entire basis of our relationship. And if I could get one person on my side, a person who thought I was an idiot, the rest of the world would surely follow. Ideas + persistence = manifesting your reality.</p>\n\n<p>I think it was the legendary management guru Michael Scott (quoting IBM founder Steve Jobs) who said “skate to where the puck is going to be, not where it has been”. Well, my long chopped sandwich skate has finally paid off — the puck is here! According to The Takeout, <a href=\"https://thetakeout.com/what-is-chopped-salad-sandwich-how-to-make-tiktok-trend-1851235474\">the chopped sandwich is all the rage on TikTok!</a></p>\n\n<blockquote><p>If you enjoy a good chopped salad, the kind where every component (veggies, cheese, protein) is chopped into uniformly forkable bites and then tossed in dressing, you’re halfway to a chopped salad sandwich, sometimes just referred to as a chopped sandwich. It’s simply any version of that same salad, just stuffed into a hinge-cut roll. The shape of the roll is crucial, as it prevents all the fillings from falling out the sides.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Yes, exactly. Wow. I’ve never felt so seen. What’s that smell? No, not a delicious chopped sandwich…it’s the sweet smell of V-I-N-D-I-C-A-T-I-O-N.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>Nearly any filling is a candidate for a chopped salad sandwich, and that’s the part that appeals most to TikTok users. Beyond the go-to Italian sub, you can create chopped salad sandwiches that contain Vietnamese banh mi ingredients, wedge salads, Caesar salads, whatever your heart desires. And that versatility means it’s a goldmine for social media content.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>A goldmine! You’re goddamn right it’s a goldmine! The time is right, the market is <em>PRIMED</em>, Gen Z is on board, it’s now or never. We’re gonna do it, Choppke’s is a go!</p>\n\n<p>Now, just to properly calibrate expectations, I haven’t looked at any commercial real estate nor have I made a single chopped sandwich of any kind at home to test out whether they actually taste better or not because I just know they will. What I <em>do</em> have is the idea (which is amazing, as we’ve agreed), a janky misspelled AI logo, and a dream.</p>\n\n<p>Right now, you’re probably wondering how you can help, how you can climb aboard this rocket ship, how you can secure a place in a better future for us all. Well, I’m happy to announce that you can join the movement for better, tastier sandwiches today by zhuzhing yourself up <a href=\"https://www.zazzle.com/z/537gofer?rf=238393244468029176\">with an exclusive Choppke’s t-shirt</a>!</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.zazzle.com/z/537gofer?rf=238393244468029176\"><img src=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/choppkes-04.jpg\" srcset=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=500,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/choppkes-04.jpg 500w, /cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/choppkes-04.jpg 1200w\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1080\" height=\"1080\" alt=\"a handsomer man than Jason wearing a Choppke's tshirt\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>All proceeds from shirt sales will be pumped into developing the Choppke’s franchise (or, if that doesn’t work out, buying myself sandwiches from the local deli). Thanks for the support everyone — even though I could have done it without you, I definitely couldn’t have done it without you.</p>\n\n <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Choppke%27s\">Choppke’s</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/food\">food</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Jason%20Kottke\">Jason Kottke</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/restaurants\">restaurants</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/sandwiches\">sandwiches</a></p>\n\n <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/03/welcome-to-choppkes\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"37f99bb0149d73cb3e5b933194800f5a8b6acb706a98b48037cec7d8a11eab44","category":"default"}
