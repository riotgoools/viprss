He told this anecdote about how Steven Spielberg and George Lucas were both influenced by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_Dodgers_in_the_24%C2%BDth_Century\">a particular space-themed cartoon</a> of his:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>Porky was just a kind of a little third-string Boy Scout and was not very interesting to me. And then when I put him in a picture called Duck Dodgers in the 24th and a Half Century. Spielberg used that picture in Close Encounters the Third Kind - when his kids were watching television in the picture, they were watching Duck Dodgers in the 24th and a Half Century. And Lucas told me that he saw that picture when he was 12 years old and when when he opened Star Wars in San Francisco he told them they couldnâ€™t have Star Wars in San Francisco unless they ran Duck Dodgers in the 24th and a Half Century.</p></blockquote>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/animation\">animation</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/cartoons\">cartoons</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Chuck%20Jones\">Chuck Jones</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/interviews\">interviews</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/video\">video</a></p>\n\n         <p>ðŸ’¬ <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/04/watch-chuck-jones-draw-bugs-bunny-daffy-duck-and-porky-pig\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> â†’</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"18d7f02757cb58885302fc27924d5afc425c5a653b1fd1d097caf3ebcf570e00","category":"default"}
