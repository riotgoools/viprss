For a youth-hockey kid, playing spring league is the equivalent of a minor-league pitcher playing winter ball in Mexico — so necessary as a statement of intent and means of improvement that forgoing it is like giving up “the path.” Rather than a simple affirmative nod, as I’d expected, I got these words: “I’m going to think about it.” <em>Think about it?</em> For me, this was the same as a girlfriend saying, “We need to talk.”</p>\n\n<p>Only later did I realize that those words were the first move in a careful choreography. My son wanted to quit, but in a way that would not break my heart. He also didn’t want me to rant and rave and try to talk him out of it.</p>\n\n<p>We had reversed roles. He was the adult. I was the child.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>I find the life-long child/parent role-reversal dynamic endlessly fascinating. And also this bit:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>He had no inherent genius for the game, but he loved it, and that love, which was his talent, and the corresponding desire to spend every free moment at the facility — the life of a rink rat — jumping onto the ice whenever an extra player was needed, shooting tape balls in the lobby, made him an asset. A kid can have all the skills, speed, size, and shot, but if he doesn’t want to be there, if he doesn’t love the game, it’s not going to work.</p>\n\n<p>It was passion that got him onto the top teams (this was tier-two and tier-three hockey in Fairfield County, Connecticut) and thus sowed the seed that eventually became, for me, a bitter plant. His love for the game elevated him to the hypercompetitive, goal-fixated ranks, where it’s always about the next tryout and the next season, who will make it and, more important, who will be left behind. Irony: His love for the game had carried him to a level where no love is possible.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Both of my kids are skiers competing on a national level and they are definitely struggling with this — how do you balance the genuine love of a sport and competition with the fixation on goals &amp; judging? When is it no longer worth it?</p>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/parenting\">parenting</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Rich%20Cohen\">Rich Cohen</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/sports\">sports</a></p>\n\n         <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/05/on-sports-parenting\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"aefc9537e07818d645a414842201b6668ecd0f95ada97299fbe4d1377ccb915d","category":"default"}
