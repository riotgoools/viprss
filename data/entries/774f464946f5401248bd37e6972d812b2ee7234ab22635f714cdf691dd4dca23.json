It’s Iron Chef, but in Adobe Illustrator.</p>\n\n<p>Imagine a client asking for a logo in 24 hours, but not telling you the name of the company! That’s what it’s like to participate in the veepstakes. Nobody who commented on the Biden/Harris logo realized that Robyn Kanner and I were busy developing *dozens* of possible identities in parallel, completely firewalled from the political side of things, awaiting the news until 40 minutes before press time.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>The current Harris/Walz logo is based on <a href=\"https://eyeondesign.aiga.org/want-to-become-the-next-u-s-president-change-the-color-of-your-logo/\">the design of Harris’s presidential campaign materials from 2020</a>, which “smartly riffed on <a href=\"https://www.si.edu/spotlight/shirley-chisholm\">the 1972 Shirley Chisholm campaign</a>”.</p>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/design\">design</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Jonathan%20Hoefler\">Jonathan Hoefler</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Kamala%20Harris\">Kamala Harris</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/politics\">politics</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Shirley%20Chisholm\">Shirley Chisholm</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/typography\">typography</a></p>\n\n         <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/08/the-intense-process-of-designing-political-campaign-logos\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"774f464946f5401248bd37e6972d812b2ee7234ab22635f714cdf691dd4dca23","category":"default"}
