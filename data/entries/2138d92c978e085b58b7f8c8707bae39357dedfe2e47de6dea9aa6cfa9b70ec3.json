If Trump is guilty (spoiler: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump%E2%80%93Raffensperger_phone_call\">he is</a>) then if he isn't punished we no longer have the rule of law. So don't miss that we are on trial too. And -- when journalism frames the faceoff as Democrat vs Republican, they ignore us, the people of the United States. Whether people know it or not, they will lose if the Republicans win. We know that, it's provable. And anything that's true should be built into the stories journalism writes about.","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"2138d92c978e085b58b7f8c8707bae39357dedfe2e47de6dea9aa6cfa9b70ec3","category":"default"}
