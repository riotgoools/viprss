Something for writers? Perhaps something that moves WordPress into a space adjacent to twitter-like systems? They just added support for <a href=\"https://www.threads.net/@davew\">Threads</a> to WordPress, so now you can <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/social/\">crosspost</a> from a blog to a thread. Haven't tried it yet. They also have a new <a href=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/2024/06/03/profiles-as-a-service/\">identity system</a> built around Gravatar, announced in early June. It'll be interesting to see what they come out with. I wonder if there is a developer ecosystem building on this, and if they have an evangelism program. I have my own vision of how these things should work.","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"f4d9e9a7f0c76d7ebc6cca62279fa37379b31b6240262e93ce7e1f490b17ff1f","category":"default"}
