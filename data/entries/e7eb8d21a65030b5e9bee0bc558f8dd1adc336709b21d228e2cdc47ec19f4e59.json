This is the kinds of thread we used to form in the blogosphere. I don't have an opinion about whether he will or won't have one, but for me, the process of putting this together in 2024 has been a really good thing. I'm much better in touch with what other people are doing. My blogroll does more that it did 20 years ago. Actually it's a lot like his <a href=\"https://sources.werd.io/\">Sources page</a>, but more compact. I'm glad we're having this discussion. It's <i>exactly</i> what I hoped would happen. And of course my feed list is behind my blogroll.","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"e7eb8d21a65030b5e9bee0bc558f8dd1adc336709b21d228e2cdc47ec19f4e59","category":"default"}
