It would be one thing if we placed a high value on being informed and thoughtful, but we're going the other way. However, if we <i>were</i> aiming to be as smart and knowledgable as possible, we'd be losing to them anyway. The machines have infinitely expandable memory, and we don't and we lose stuff, and we hallucinate a lot more than they do. But why is it a problem if a machine does something better than we do, even something we (foolishly) think we're the best at. That's why we make machines. I have a great car, and live in a house that's heated in the winter and cooled in the summer. If I want to travel to the other side of the world, no problem. These are all things that machines do for me. One thing a machine might not be good at is inspiration. I asked ChatGPT to give me a good idea for something to write today. The idea it <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com/share/194f509d-b494-4277-9cd4-5278e83f98ec\">came up with</a>: \"The Day the World Forgot How to Yawn.\" I rest my case.","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"aabd44e3a1c2064a464ba0054ec41567e79d41b283e822a4100bcc53f7439894","category":"default"}
