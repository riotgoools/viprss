Early architects of these camps veiled their efforts in scientific terms while using terror and punishment to seize more power.</p>\n\n<p>For example, Trump has claimed repeatedly that undocumented immigrants are “poisoning the blood” of the U.S. “Blood poisoning” is a medical condition; saying that foreigners are poisoning a nation’s blood is simply a slur. But perverting scientific or medical language to violate human rights and permit atrocities comes from a familiar playbook.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/07/inside-the-trump-plan-for-2025\">Again</a>, this stuff is all right out in the open — no reading between the lines required.</p>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Andrea%20Pitzer\">Andrea Pitzer</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/crime\">crime</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Donald%20Trump\">Donald Trump</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/politics\">politics</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/racism\">racism</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/science\">science</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/USA\">USA</a></p>\n\n        \n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"3acefc983474e02da8117dbc3bfa791cd86256d411f43b88cb23e9d53fee510f","category":"default"}
