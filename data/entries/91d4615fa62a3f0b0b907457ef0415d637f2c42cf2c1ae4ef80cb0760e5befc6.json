That's when the pulse really starts. </p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/07/10/upcomingEpisodes.png\">screen shot</a> of upcoming episodes from <a href=\"http://morningcoffeenotes.com/\">morningcoffeenotes</a>.</p>\n<p>Here's the <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/quantum-light-breath/id1752527298?i=1000661785816\">Apple Podcasts</a> page for this episode. </p>\n<p>I've been making mistakes in 2024 on almost every episode. This time I got the title wrong, it's Sunrise of the Soul. Rather than change it, and take a chance of the episode showing up twice in some podcast clients, I'm just leaving it as-is. Trying to get a feel for how most of the clients work. Do they refresh posts, if the descriptions change (as this one is)? I don't know. </p>\n<p>Do the clients strip out the HTML or do they support some of it? I wonder if links make it through to most clients?</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2024/06/17/152838.html\">original post</a> for Podcast0.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"91d4615fa62a3f0b0b907457ef0415d637f2c42cf2c1ae4ef80cb0760e5befc6","category":"default"}
