We lurch into loving, only to discover again and again that it takes a long time to know people, to understand people — and <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2015/03/31/how-to-love-thich-nhat-hanh/\">“understanding is love’s other name.”</a> Even without intentional deception, people will surprise you, will shock you, will hurt you — not out of malice, but out of the incompleteness of their own self-knowledge, which continually leads them to surprise themselves. More often than not, when someone breaks a promise, it is because they believed themselves to be the kind of person who could keep it and found themselves to be a person who could not. If we live long enough and honestly enough, we will all find ourselves in that position eventually, for in the lifelong project of understanding ourselves, we are all reluctant visitors to the dusky and desolate haunts of our own nature, where shadows we do not want to meet dwell. But in any human association that has earned the right use the word love, we must be in relationship with both the light and the shadow in ourselves and each other. All authentic relationship is therefore a matter of clear sight — of seeing through the shining pane of the other’s self-concealment and removing the mirror of our own projections. </p>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2024/07/26/almanac-of-birds/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/BarredOwl_mistaken.jpg?resize=680%2C1052&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"680\" height=\"1052\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/BarredOwl_mistaken.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/BarredOwl_mistaken.jpg?resize=320%2C495&amp;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/BarredOwl_mistaken.jpg?resize=600%2C929&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/BarredOwl_mistaken.jpg?resize=240%2C371&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/BarredOwl_mistaken.jpg?resize=768%2C1188&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/BarredOwl_mistaken.jpg?resize=993%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 993w\" /></a><figcaption>Art from <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2024/07/26/almanac-of-birds/\"><em>An Almanac of Birds: Divinations for Uncertain Days</em></a>.

She writes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>People are so very secretive. Sometimes it is said, “Those characters and that novel are purely fantastic — nobody in real life is like that.” But people in real life are very, very odd, as soon as one gets to know them at all well, and they conceal this fact because they are frightened of appearing eccentric or shocking… What are other people really like? What goes on inside their minds? What goes on inside their houses?</p></blockquote>\n<p>It is, of course, impossible to ever fully know what it is like to be someone else — this is the cost of consciousness, singular and secretive as it is; impossible, too, to fully convey to another what it is like to be you. The dream of perfectly clear vision is indeed just a dream. But we can always see a little more clearly in order to love a little more purely.</p>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Existentialists-Mystics-Writings-Philosophy-Literature/dp/0140264922/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/irismurdoch3.jpg?resize=680%2C357&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"irismurdoch3\" width=\"680\" height=\"357\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/irismurdoch3.jpg?w=797&amp;ssl=1 797w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/irismurdoch3.jpg?resize=240%2C126&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/irismurdoch3.jpg?resize=320%2C168&amp;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/irismurdoch3.jpg?resize=768%2C403&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/irismurdoch3.jpg?resize=600%2C315&amp;ssl=1 600w\" /></a><figcaption>Iris Murdoch</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Paradoxically, while our illusions about ourselves and others are the work of fantasy, seeing clearly is the work of the imagination — of the willingness to investigate imaginatively what lives behind the masks people wear, what hides in our own blind spots. Murdoch writes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Imagination, as opposed to fantasy, is the ability to see the other thing, what one might call, to use those old-fashioned words, nature, reality, the world… Imagination is a kind of freedom, a renewed ability to perceive and express the truth.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In another essay from the book, Murdoch considers the existential jolt of discovering how poorly we know ourselves, for we are always divided between our will and our personality, the conscious and the unconscious. Whenever we face the abyss between the two, we are overcome with an uneasy feeling the existentialists called Angst. Defining it as the “fright which the conscious will feels when it apprehends the strength and direction of the personality which is not under its immediate control,” Murdoch locates Angst in any experience where we feel the discrepancy between our ideals and our personality. She writes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Extreme Angst, in the popular modern form, is a disease or addiction of those who are passionately convinced that personality resides solely in the conscious omnipotent will.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In a sense, Angst — which often manifests as anxiety, to use a presently fashionable term — is the loss of faith in the omnipotence of the rational will, the discovery that much of our conduct is governed by unconscious tendrils of our personality impervious to our conscious ideals. This makes the project of change far more complex and durational than we would like it to be. </p>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2024/07/26/almanac-of-birds/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DwarfThrush_changing.jpg?resize=680%2C1052&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"680\" height=\"1052\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DwarfThrush_changing.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DwarfThrush_changing.jpg?resize=320%2C495&amp;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DwarfThrush_changing.jpg?resize=600%2C929&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DwarfThrush_changing.jpg?resize=240%2C371&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DwarfThrush_changing.jpg?resize=768%2C1188&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DwarfThrush_changing.jpg?resize=993%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 993w\" /></a><figcaption>Art from <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2024/07/26/almanac-of-birds/\"><em>An Almanac of Birds: Divinations for Uncertain Days</em></a>.

Moral change and moral achievement are slow; we are not free in the sense of being able suddenly to alter ourselves since we cannot suddenly alter what we can see and ergo what we desire and are compelled by. In a way, explicit choice seems now less important: less decisive (since much of the “decision” lies elsewhere) and less obviously something to be “cultivated.” If I attend properly I will have no choices and this is the ultimate condition to be aimed at… Will continually influences belief, for better or worse, and is ideally able to influence it through a sustained attention to reality.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This is so because pure attention reveals the fundamental necessity of our lives, and where there is necessity there is no need for choice — there is only what Murdoch calls “obedience to reality,” which is always “an exercise of love.” Such attention — “patient, loving regard, directed upon a person, a thing, a situation” — shapes what we believe to be possible and, when coupled with the conscious will, shapes our lives. It is only through obedience to reality that we can ever see clearly enough — ourselves or another — to be in loving relationship, by discovering, in Murdoch’s lovely words, “the real which is the proper object of love.”</p>\n<p>Couple this fragment of the altogether superb <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Existentialists-Mystics-Writings-Philosophy-Literature/dp/0140264922/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>Existentialists and Mystics</em></strong></a> with Adam Phillips on <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2024/06/05/on-wanting-to-change-adam-phillips/\">the paradoxes of changing</a>, then revisit Iris Murdoch on <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2022/03/30/iris-murdoch-against-the-gods/\">how attention unmasks the universe</a> and <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2022/01/08/iris-murdoch-the-sublime-and-the-good/\">how to see more clearly</a>.</p>\n<hr /><h3>donating = loving</h3><p>For seventeen years, I have been spending hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars each month composing <em>The Marginalian</em> (which <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2021/10/22/brain-pickings-becoming-the-marginalian/\">bore the outgrown name <em>Brain Pickings</em></a> for its first fifteen years).
