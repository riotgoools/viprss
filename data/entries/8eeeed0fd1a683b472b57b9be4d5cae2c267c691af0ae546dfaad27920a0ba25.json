{"title":"On Returning to Childhood Hobbies","link":"https://kottke.org/24/03/on-returning-to-childhood-hobbies","date":1711051219000,"content":"\n        <p>I really enjoyed this <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2024/03/12/singing-as-adult/\">Cup of Jo essay</a> about the pleasure of coming back to childhood hobbies as an adult:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>The student in the session before mine is a hedge-fund guy in his 50s, and we giggle at each other in the doorway between our two lessons, as if we’re seeing through the graying hair and trench coats and wedding rings to greet our promising, 16-year-old selves.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>I know I’ve <a href=\"https://kottke.org/23/11/my-writingdrawing-process\">mentioned</a> this here before, but my own life transformed when I got back into what I loved as a kid (drawing!). I picked it up when I stopped drinking, and it’s since become one of the cornerstones of my day. </p>\n\n<p>And then on the other end of the spectrum are the hobbies we discover in mid-life, when there’s less expectation of doing “well” or of turning anything into a career, and those rule, too. It’s never too late!</p>\n\n <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/hobbies\">hobbies</a></p>\n\n <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/03/on-returning-to-childhood-hobbies\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Edith Zimmerman","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"8eeeed0fd1a683b472b57b9be4d5cae2c267c691af0ae546dfaad27920a0ba25","category":"default"}
