What would you charge to do just a <strong>one-hour show</strong>?”\n</p><p>\nI said, “$2000”.\n</p><p>\nShe said, “No, wait, you’ll be performing less, not more!”\n</p><p>\nI said, “Yeah! Exactly! What you’re paying me for is to get there! Once I’m there, playing music is the fun part! If you tell me I have to get back in the van and drive home after only an hour, then I’m going to charge you more than if you let me play for a couple hours first.”\n</p><p>\nShe liked that so much that she came up with the $1500.\n</p><p>\nPoint is:\nBusiness is creative.\nYou can do things any way you want.\nThere’s no need to adhere to norms.\nNorms are for businesses without personality.\n</p><p>\n<strong>\nPour your personality and philosophy into the way you do business.\n</strong>\nPeople actually appreciate it when you do things in a surprising way.\nIt shows you care more than most — that you’re putting your self into this — that you’re not just in it for the money.\n</p>\n<img src=\"/images/get-personal.gif\" />","author":"Derek Sivers","siteTitle":"Derek Sivers","siteHash":"4098504c0d0759e13901f29e63f7d7dbb1d972a078c6dc4560660f373da5c25e","entryHash":"f50161a474dfb9dd0d74fad64e9bcd0a3c5b8e1c90e41f98ae191574ce3070af","category":"Sites"}
