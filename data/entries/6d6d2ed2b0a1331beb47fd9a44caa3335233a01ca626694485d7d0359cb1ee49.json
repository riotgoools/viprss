This paradox remains <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2023/10/22/17/\">one of the 17 most important things I have learned about life</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/tag/nick-cave/\">Nick Cave</a>, who has lived through <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2020/07/27/nick-cave-loss-grief/\">some unimaginable loss</a>, brought the paradox of joy to the 300th edition of his wonderful journal <a href=\"https://www.theredhandfiles.com\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Red Hand Files</em></a> — an oasis of largehearted anticynicism in our world, and my favorite email by orders of magnitude. He writes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I have a full life. A privileged life. An unendangered life. But sometimes the simple joys escape me. Joy is not always a feeling that is freely bestowed upon us, often it is something we must actively seek. In a way, joy is a decision, an action, even a practised method of being. It is an earned thing brought into focus by what we have lost — at least, it can seem that way.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This paradox comes alive in Nick’s song “Joy” from his altogether soul-slaking record <a href=\"https://www.nickcave.com/releases/wild-god/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Wild God</em></a>. “We’ve all had too much sorrow — now is the time for joy,” goes a lyric spoken by the ghost of his dead son.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Some time ago, amid a season of suffering, Nick introduced me to <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2024/01/03/christian-wiman-love/\">the soulful work</a> of poet Christian Wiman and sent me his lifeline of an anthology <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Joy-100-Poems-Christian-Wiman/dp/0300248636/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>Joy: 100 Poems</em></strong></a> (<a href=\"https://search.worldcat.org/title/1420447483\" target=\"_blank\"><em>public library</em></a>) — a kaleidoscopic lens on, as Wiman writes in the introduction, “why a moment of joy can blast you right out of the life to which it makes you all the more lovingly and tenaciously attached, or why this lift into pure bliss might also entail a steep drop of concomitant loss.”</p>\n<p>Among the hundred poems, as various as Gertrude Stein and Lucille Clifton, is the plainly and pointedly titled “Joy” by one of my favorite poets: Lisel Mueller, who lived nearly a century and wrote with such ravishing poignancy about <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2020/02/24/immortality-in-passing-lisel-mueller/\">the consolations of mortality</a> and <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2020/05/07/lisel-mueller-romantics/\">the dazzling complexities that make life worth living</a>.</p>\n<p>YOUTUBE</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>JOY</strong><br />\n<em>by Lisel Mueller</em></p>\n<p>“Don’t cry, it’s only music,”<br />\nsomeone’s voice is saying.<br />\n“No one you love is dying.”</p>\n<p>It’s only music. And it was only spring,<br />\nthe world’s unreasoning body<br />\nrun amok, like a saint’s, with glory,<br />\nthat overwhelmed a young girl<br />\ninto unreasoning sadness.<br />\n“Crazy,” she told herself,<br />\n“I should be dancing with happiness.”</p>\n<p>But it happened again. It happens<br />\nwhen we make bottomless love —<br />\nthere follows a bottomless sadness<br />\nwhich is not despair<br />\nbut its nameless opposite.<br />\nIt has nothing to do with the passing of time.<br />\nIt’s not about loss. It’s about<br />\ntwo seemingly parallel lines<br />\nsuddenly coming together<br />\ninside us, in some place<br />\nthat is still wilderness.<br />\nJoy, joy, the sopranos sing,<br />\nreaching for the shimmering notes<br />\nwhile our eyes fill with tears.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Couple with Nick’s beautiful of reading of <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2024/04/06/but-we-had-music/\">“But We Had Music,”</a> then revisit poet Ross Gay on <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2019/12/01/ross-gay-book-of-delights/\">delight as a force of resistance</a>.</p>\n<hr /><h3>donating = loving</h3><p>For seventeen years, I have been spending hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars each month composing <em>The Marginalian</em> (which <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2021/10/22/brain-pickings-becoming-the-marginalian/\">bore the outgrown name <em>Brain Pickings</em></a> for its first fifteen years).
