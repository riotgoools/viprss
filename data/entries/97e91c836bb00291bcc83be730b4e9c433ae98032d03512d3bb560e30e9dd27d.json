Dani and I got to know each other dating back to when she was an analyst at USV from 2018 to 202. During that time we had a blast working together on lots of things, including making investments, writing blog posts together and building apps together.</p>\n<p>One of the things that always stood out to me about Dani is the infectious energy that she brings to the process of building things, especially building things as a team.
