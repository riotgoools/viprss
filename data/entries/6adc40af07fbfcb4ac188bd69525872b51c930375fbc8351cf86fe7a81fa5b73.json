Being “the media”means taking responsibility to verify facts, engage with opposing views, and avoid falling prey to algorithms that prioritize engagement over truth.</p><p>While platforms like X have democratized content creation, they are no substitute for journalistic rigor and accountability. True media literacy requires blending insights from multiple sources, including those with professional standards. </p><p>Rather than abandoning traditional [journalism and media] entirely, we should challenge it to do better while supplementing it with a variety of voices, platforms, and perspectives.”</p><h2>IShowSpeed wins streamer of the year at the Streamer Awards</h2><div><figure><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F219d5e42-c8f8-406d-ab64-5f60f25edf69_1080x720.webp\"><div><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F219d5e42-c8f8-406d-ab64-5f60f25edf69_1080x720.webp\" width=\"624\" height=\"416\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F219d5e42-c8f8-406d-ab64-5f60f25edf69_1080x720.webp 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F219d5e42-c8f8-406d-ab64-5f60f25edf69_1080x720.webp 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F219d5e42-c8f8-406d-ab64-5f60f25edf69_1080x720.webp 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F219d5e42-c8f8-406d-ab64-5f60f25edf69_1080x720.webp 1456w\" loading=\"lazy\" /><div></div></div></a><figcaption>ishowspeed has become a breakout creator in the past year</figcaption></figure></div><p>The Streamer Awards are an annual awards show founded in 2022 by QTCinderella, a livestreamer with over one million Twitch followers.

I do!! </p><p>You see, Vox/VMPN cannot make “a decision not to renew the show” because <em>I</em> actually own 100% of my show and all of the IP. Vox also doesn’t distribute the show on YouTube either, <em>I</em> do. Also, the show isn’t in any sort of seasons, it’s an ongoing (mostly weekly, sometimes biweekly) interview show, so there’s nothing up for “renewal.” VMPN initially invested money in getting <em>Power User</em> off the ground and (while I can’t get into the specifics of their behind the scenes help), they’ve been absolutely wonderful to work with.</p><p>It’s extremely frustrating that a “media reporter” would take zero time to learn about the ownership structure of podcast before misleading people to think it’s been cancelled, and that he would make it seem like I have some sort of bad blood with the amazing group of people at VMPN who I remain very close with. I built my entire independent media business in a way so that no corporation ever has <em>any</em> control over any of my journalistic or creative work. I don’t compromise on this, even for companies I love. </p><p>But these male media reporters who have some sort of derangement syndrome over me will happily lie or mislead the public if it gets them clicks and furthers a personal agenda.</p><p>Then Anyway, VMPN continues to be great and you can listen to this week’s episode of <em><a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/5iganPXXEoTDB9lIQzY7Fh\">Power User</a></em> here! </p><div><div><div><p>User Mag is a 100% reader-supported publication.
