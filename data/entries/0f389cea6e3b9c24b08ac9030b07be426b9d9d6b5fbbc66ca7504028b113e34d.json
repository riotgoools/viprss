After a dramatic escape, Kropotkin spent four decades in exile across Western Europe and went on to influence generations of thinkers with this radical insistence on cooperation and solidarity, not the struggle for power, as the true engine of survival and flourishing.</p>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/peterkropotkin_nadar.jpg?resize=680%2C1055&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"680\" height=\"1055\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/peterkropotkin_nadar.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/peterkropotkin_nadar.jpg?resize=320%2C496&amp;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/peterkropotkin_nadar.jpg?resize=600%2C931&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/peterkropotkin_nadar.jpg?resize=240%2C372&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/peterkropotkin_nadar.jpg?resize=768%2C1191&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/peterkropotkin_nadar.jpg?resize=990%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 990w\" /><figcaption>Peter Kropotkin by <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2016/03/24/felix-nadar-male-female-when-i-was-a-photographer/\">Félix Nadar</a>.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Having fallen under Darwin’s spell as a teenager, Kropotkin came to see in evolutionary science an optimistic model for the elevation of human conscience — in the history of life on Earth, across which organisms have continually improved their biological adaptation for survival, he found assurance for a better future forged by our continual moral improvement. </p>\n<p>Unable to obtain the scientific education he yearned for, the young Kropotkin took a post as an officer in Siberia (where Dostoyevsky <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2024/09/01/dostyevsky-general-letter/\">was serving in a labor camp</a>), then used his military credentials to join geological expeditions studying glaciation, all the while witnessing staggering corruption and abuses of power in local government while the peasants governed themselves through deep bonds of mutual trust that seemed purer, more primal, and closer to nature than any political power structure. </p>\n<p>Challenging the anthropocentric view of other animals, Kropotkin considers the deepest driving force beneath the harmony and coherence of nature:</p>\n<blockquote><p>To reduce animal sociability to love and sympathy means to reduce its generality and its importance, just as human ethics based upon love and personal sympathy only have contributed to narrow the comprehension of the moral feeling as a whole. It is not love to my neighbour — whom I often do not know at all — which induces me to seize a pail of water and to rush towards his house when I see it on fire; it is a far wider, even though more vague feeling or instinct of human solidarity and sociability which moves me. So it is also with animals. It is not love, and not even sympathy (understood in its proper sense) which induces a herd of ruminants or of horses to form a ring in order to resist an attack of wolves; not love which induces wolves to form a pack for hunting; not love which induces kittens or lambs to play, or a dozen of species of young birds to spend their days together in the autumn; and it is neither love nor personal sympathy which induces many thousand fallow-deer scattered over a territory as large as France to form into a score of separate herds, all marching towards a given spot, in order to cross there a river. It is a feeling infinitely wider than love or personal sympathy — an instinct that has been slowly developed among animals and humans in the course of an extremely long evolution, and which has taught animals and humans alike the force they can borrow from the practice of mutual aid and support, and the joys they can find in social life.</p></blockquote>\n<figure><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/art-by-virginia-frances-sterrett-from-old-french-fairy-tales-1920_print?curator=brainpicker\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/oldfrenchfairytales_sterrett2.jpg?resize=680%2C883&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Art by Virginia Frances Sterrett, Old French Fairy Tales, 1920\" width=\"680\" height=\"883\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/oldfrenchfairytales_sterrett2.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/oldfrenchfairytales_sterrett2.jpg?resize=320%2C416&amp;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/oldfrenchfairytales_sterrett2.jpg?resize=600%2C780&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/oldfrenchfairytales_sterrett2.jpg?resize=240%2C312&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/oldfrenchfairytales_sterrett2.jpg?resize=768%2C998&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/oldfrenchfairytales_sterrett2.jpg?resize=1182%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 1182w\" /></a><figcaption>Century-old art by the adolescent <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2022/01/27/virginia-frances-sterrett-old-french-fairy-tales/\">Virginia Frances Sterrett</a>.

But it is not love and not even sympathy upon which Society is based in mankind. It is the conscience — be it only at the stage of an instinct — of human solidarity. It is the unconscious recognition of the force that is borrowed by each person from the practice of mutual aid; of the close dependency of every one’s happiness upon the happiness of all; and of the sense of justice, or equity, which brings the individual to consider the rights of every other individual as equal to his own.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Complement with Albert Camus on <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2016/06/17/albert-camus-the-rebel/\">what solidarity means</a> and Lewis Thomas’s forgotten masterpiece of perspective on <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2022/03/02/the-fragile-species-lewis-thomas/\">how to live with our human nature</a>, then revisit Kropotkin on <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2022/10/28/peter-kropotkin-the-spirit-of-revolt/\">how to reboot a complacent society</a> and <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2022/04/20/peter-kropotkin-revolt-appeal-to-the-young/\">the art of putting your gift in the service of the world</a>.</p>\n<hr /><h3>donating = loving</h3><p>For seventeen years, I have been spending hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars each month composing <em>The Marginalian</em> (which <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2021/10/22/brain-pickings-becoming-the-marginalian/\">bore the outgrown name <em>Brain Pickings</em></a> for its first fifteen years).
