The cloud model doesn’t seem to maintain state or history and isn’t frontier. It looks like GPT-4 is just for specific questions.</p>\n<p>It is amazing that you can beat Siri largely with local AI on the phone, but the gap between a 3B model (plus whatever low latency model they are running in the cloud) and a frontier model is large.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The way I interpret what Apple is doing when it comes to AI, at least at this point from a consumer standpoint, is that they are going for the fundamentals and the lower-end use cases vs. the higher-end or edges of what might be possible. This feels safe and feels very Apple-ish to me. They care deeply about the experience and the experience of using AI for most people is not great a lot of the time.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"micro.brad","siteHash":"27daae1c149c6ec5a964b1fe9266f5a58f96cfb4b36e39006f255c6b2b53a76d","entryHash":"454652b239f16680b3079bbdb1abc0cb002f3594b68e6d42e64d1b5f8a4eb6ee","category":"default"}
