They also discuss what Coleman’s learned from J.J. Johnson, the hardest thing about performing the trombone, playing sets in the Charles Mingus Big Band as a teenager, whether Billy Joel is any good, what reservations he has about his conservative fans, why the Beastie Boys are overrated, what he’s learned from Noam Dworman, why <em>Interstellar</em> is Chris Nolan’s masterpiece, the Coleman Hughes production function, why political debate is so toxic, what he’ll do next, and more.</p></blockquote>\r\n<p>Here is one excerpt:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><strong>COWEN:</strong> How was it you ended up playing trombone in <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.charlesmingus.com/mingus-big-band\" target=\"_blank\">Charles Mingus Big Band</a>?</p>\r\n<p><strong>HUGHES:</strong> I participated in the Charles Mingus high school jazz festival, which they still do every year. It was new at the time. They invite bands from all around to audition, and they identify a handful of good soloists and let them sit in for one night with the band. I sat in with the band, and the band leader knew that I lived close by in New Jersey, and so essentially invited me to start playing with the band on Monday nights.</p>\r\n<p>I was probably 16 or 17 at this point, so I would take the NJ Transit into New York City on a Monday night, play two sets with the Mingus Band sitting next to people that had been my idols and were now my mentors — people like <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.charlesmingus.com/kuumba-frank-lacy\" target=\"_blank\">Ku-umba Frank Lacy</a>, who is a fantastic trombone player; played with <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.britannica.com/biography/Art-Blakey\" target=\"_blank\">Art Blakey</a> and <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.youtube.com/@dangelo3439/featured\" target=\"_blank\">D’Angelo</a> and so forth. Then I would go home at midnight and go to school on Tuesday morning.</p>\r\n<p><strong>COWEN:</strong> Why is the music of <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.britannica.com/biography/Charles-Mingus\" target=\"_blank\">Charles Mingus</a> special in jazz? Because it is to me, but how would you articulate what it is for you?</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Here is another:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><strong>COWEN:</strong> If I understand you correctly, you’re also suggesting in our private lives we should be color-blind.</p>\r\n<p><strong>HUGHES:</strong> Yes. Broadly, yes. Or we should try to be.</p>\r\n<p><strong>COWEN:</strong> We should try to be. This is where I might not agree with you. So I find if I look at media, I look at social media, I see a dispute — I think 100 percent of the time I agree with Coleman, pretty much, on these race-related matters. In private lives, I’m less sure.</p>\r\n<p>Let me ask you a question.</p>\r\n<p><strong>HUGHES:</strong> Sure.</p>\r\n<p><strong>COWEN:</strong> Could jazz music have been created in a color-blind America?</p>\r\n<p><strong>HUGHES:</strong> Could it have been created in a color-blind America — in what sense do you mean that question?</p>\r\n<p><strong>COWEN:</strong> It seems there’s a lot of cultural creativity. One issue is it may have required some hardship, but that’s not my point. It requires some sense of a cultural identity to motivate it — that the people making it want to express something about their lives, their history, their communities. And to them it’s not color-blind.</p>\r\n<p><strong>HUGHES:</strong> Interesting. My counterargument to that would be, insofar as I understand the early history of jazz, it was heavily more racially integrated than American society was at that time. In the sense that the culture of jazz music as it existed in, say, New Orleans and New York City was many, many decades ahead of the curve in terms of its attitudes towards how people should live racially: interracial friendship, interracial relationship, etc. Yes, I’d argue the ethos of jazz was more color-blind, in my sense, than the American average at the time.</p>\r\n<p><strong>COWEN:</strong> But maybe there’s some portfolio effect here. So yes, <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.npr.org/2009/05/30/104713445/benny-goodman-forever-the-king-of-swing\" target=\"_blank\">Benny Goodman</a> hires <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.arts.gov/honors/jazz/teddy-wilson\" target=\"_blank\">Teddy Wilson</a> to play for him. Teddy Wilson was black, as I’m sure you know. And that works marvelously well. It’s just good for the world that Benny Goodman does this.</p>\r\n<p>Can it still not be the case that Teddy Wilson is pulling from something deep in his being, in his soul — about his racial experience, his upbringing, the people he’s known — and that that’s where a lot of the expression in the music comes from? That is most decidedly not color-blind, even though we would all endorse the fact that Benny Goodman was willing to hire Teddy Wilson.</p>\r\n<p><strong>HUGHES:</strong> Yes. Maybe — I’d argue it may not be <em>culture</em>-blind, though it probably is color-blind, in the sense that black Americans don’t just represent a race. That’s what a black American would have in common — that’s what <em>I</em> would have in common with someone from Ethiopia, is that we’re broadly of the same “race.” We are not at all of the same culture.</p>\r\n<p>To the extent that there is something called “African American culture,” which I believe that there is, which has had many wonderful products, including jazz and hip-hop — yes, then I’m perfectly willing to concede that that’s a cultural product in the same way that, say, country music is like a product of broadly Southern culture.</p>\r\n<p><strong>COWEN:</strong> But then here’s my worry a bit. You’re going to have people privately putting out cultural visions in the public sphere through music, television, novels — a thousand ways — and those will inevitably be somewhat political once they’re cultural visions. So these other visions will be out there, and a lot of them you’re going to disagree with. It might be fine to say, “It would be better if we were all much more color-blind.” But given these other non-color-blind visions are out there, do you not have to, in some sense, counter them by not being so color-blind yourself and say, “Well, here’s a better way to think about the black or African American or Ethiopian or whatever identity”?</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Interesting throughout.</p>\r\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/05/my-conversation-with-the-excellent-coleman-hughes.html\">My Conversation with the excellent Coleman Hughes</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com\">Marginal REVOLUTION</a>.</p>\r\n<img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/890575664/0/marginalrevolution\" />\r\n<div><a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/890575664/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/890575664/marginalrevolution,\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/890575664/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/x.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/890575664/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/890575664/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/05/my-conversation-with-the-excellent-coleman-hughes.html#comments\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/comments20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/05/my-conversation-with-the-excellent-coleman-hughes.html/feed\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/commentsrss20.png\" /></a> \r\n<div><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/05/my-conversation-with-the-excellent-coleman-hughes.html#comments\"><h3>Comments</h3></a><ul><li><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/05/my-conversation-with-the-excellent-coleman-hughes.html#comment-160752742\">In reply to Anonymous.
