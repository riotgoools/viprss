I just did it in Voice Memos on my computer. I then put it into a collection of stuff for my kids. There are quotes, advice, links to things, lists and other stuff that I’m collecting for my kids as a reflection of me and my values. More parents should do this kind of thing.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"micro.brad","siteHash":"27daae1c149c6ec5a964b1fe9266f5a58f96cfb4b36e39006f255c6b2b53a76d","entryHash":"a2e0516a11e64d1f7f2db2e339d35d7c32eaf0902538fcaed3f026095cf7cdd8","category":"Sites"}
