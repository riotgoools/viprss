Ulrich Leisinger, head of research at the foundation, tells Deutsche Presse-Agentur (DPA) that the young composer was no longer creating pieces that sounded like this one by the time he was in his late teens.</p>\n\n<p>In his early years, however, Mozart wrote many chamber works like Serenade in C, which his father recorded on a list of his son’s compositions. Many of these works were thought to have been lost to history, as Leisinger says in the statement. Fortunately, this particular piece was saved — thanks to the composer’s sister.</p>\n\n<p>“It looks as if — thanks to a series of favorable circumstances — a complete string trio has survived in Leipzig,” Leisinger adds. “The source was evidently Mozart’s sister, and so it is tempting to think that she preserved the work as a memento of her brother. Perhaps he wrote the trio specially for her.”</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>(via <a href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2024/09/watch-the-performance-of-a-mozart-composition-that-had-been-lost-for-centuries.html\">open culture</a>)</p>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/music\">music</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/video\">video</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Wolfgang%20Amadeus%20Mozart\">Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart</a></p>\n\n         <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/09/listen-to-a-performance-of-some-new-mozart-music\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"c0dfedf2b9f9bd529e030d76b042a20796656fb0459800d740cef85b9acbdfa4","category":"Sites"}
