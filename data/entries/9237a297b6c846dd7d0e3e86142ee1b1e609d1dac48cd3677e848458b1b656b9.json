Too many of us look at freedom as the absence of state power: We think weâ€™re free if we can do and say as we please, and protect ourselves from government overreach. But true freedom isnâ€™t so much freedom <em>from</em> as freedom <em>to</em> â€” the freedom to thrive, to take risks for futures we choose by working together. Freedom is the value that makes all other values possible.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>If youâ€™ve been reading this site for any length of time, youâ€™ll know that <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/07/we-choose-freedom\">I am in favor of the type of freedom Snyder describes</a>.
