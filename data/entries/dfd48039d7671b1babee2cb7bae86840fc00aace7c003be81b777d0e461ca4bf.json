{"title":"Baker&#8217;s Chocolate Wasn&#8217;t Made For Bakers","link":"https://kottke.org/24/11/bakers-chocolate-wasnt-made-for-bakers","date":1732221386000,"content":"\n        <p>I hope this doesnâ€™t ruin your day, but <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baker%27s_Chocolate\">Bakerâ€™s Chocolate wasnâ€™t created for bakers</a>, itâ€™s chocolate originally produced in Dorchester, MA by John Hannon with his partner Dr. James Baker. Hannon sailed to the West Indies in 1779 and never came back, so Dr. Baker changed the name to the Baker Chocolate Company.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, German Chocolate Cake isnâ€™t German. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_chocolate_cake\">A homemaker from Dallas sent the Dallas Morning News a recipe for Germanâ€™s Chocolate Cake</a> made with a sweet baking chocolate invented by Samuel German in 1853. (Iâ€™m not including the name of the homemaker because sheâ€™s listed everywhere as Mrs. Husbandâ€™s Name and YOU KNOW that guy never picked up a sifter to help.) I personally donâ€™t believe coconut or nuts belong in dessert so I donâ€™t fw German Chocolate Cake if I can help it. </p>\n\n<p>Hereâ€™s where youâ€™re about to get really mad. Hereâ€™s where youâ€™re about to blow a gasket. Hereâ€™s the thing what will make you absolutely furious like me. Guess which companyâ€™s sales increased 73% after the popularization of German Chocolate Cake as a thing Americans were making regularly? Thatâ€™s right, itâ€™s Bakerâ€™s Chocolate Company, Samuel Germanâ€™s employer in 1853 when he invented the chocolate.
