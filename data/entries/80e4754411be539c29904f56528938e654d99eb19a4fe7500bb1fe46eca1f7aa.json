On a mobile device, sometimes you have to click several times on a tab to get it to switch. It doesn't seem to happen in desktop browsers. Yesterday I finally got it to reproduce on my own machine, when emulating an iPad Mini in Chrome on my desktop. I added debugging code and set breakpoints, and had a theory that tooltips were interfering, which turned out not to be the case, but now that I can reproduce it here, I really want to get this solved. If you have development experience, or just like a good technical puzzle, <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/287#issuecomment-1983757115\">here's the thread</a>. Help much appreciated.","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"80e4754411be539c29904f56528938e654d99eb19a4fe7500bb1fe46eca1f7aa","category":"default"}
