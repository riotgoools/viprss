I turned the lock slowly and shut the door with the handle all the way to the left to avoid the click of the lock. Took off my shoes. Rolled my feet from heel to toe, which is how ninjas walk so silently. I was often two or three hours late because I had trouble admitting that I was planning to talk to Jordi for five hours. But how could it be any shorter, given that it was my one chance a week to be myself? My heart was pounding as I tiptoed through the living room. I know the quietest way to wash up, too: picking up and putting down the cup and face wash with this technique where you pretend each thing is heavier than it is. Imagine the cup is made of brick, so that as you put it down youâ€™re also lifting it up, resisting its weight â€” the opposite of this would be just dropping it, letting gravity put it down. When I walk past Harrisâ€™s bedroom I think <em>glide, glide, glide</em>.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>See also Edithâ€™s diary comics: <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/07/reading-miranda-julys-all-fours\">Reading Miranda Julyâ€™s All Fours</a>.</p>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/All%20Fours\">All Fours</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/books\">books</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Miranda%20July\">Miranda July</a></p>\n\n         <p>ðŸ’¬ <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/07/parker-or-driver\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> â†’</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"2762e7477a7a896c9c37d23e1fb9f17882e6b8e8b6c216dab711b5baeb5e520a","category":"default"}
