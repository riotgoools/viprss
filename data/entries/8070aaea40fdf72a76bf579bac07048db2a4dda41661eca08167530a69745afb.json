They reply to my emails! You can talk to a real person!”\n</p><p>\nWho could have guessed?\nDespite all your efforts put into features, pricing, design, partnerships, and more, <strong>people will choose one company over another just because they like the customer service</strong>.\n</p><p>\nSo I structured my company to match this priority.\nOut of my 85 employees, 28 were full-time customer service.\n</p><p>\nCustomer service is not an expense to be minimized.\nIt’s a core profit center, like sales.\n<strong>\nIt’s where you should put your best people.\n</strong>\n</p><p>\nHire the sweetest, most empathetic people, and make sure they have all the time and resources they need to make your customers very happy.\nIf they get so busy that their interactions are getting succinct, it’s time to hire another.\nIt’s worth it.\n</p><p>\nIt’s much harder to get a new customer than it is to get more business from an existing customer.\nCompanies focus so much on getting new customers, but keeping existing customers thrilled is a better investment.\n</p>","author":"Derek Sivers","siteTitle":"Derek Sivers","siteHash":"4098504c0d0759e13901f29e63f7d7dbb1d972a078c6dc4560660f373da5c25e","entryHash":"8070aaea40fdf72a76bf579bac07048db2a4dda41661eca08167530a69745afb","category":"default"}
