{"title":"WordPress as the platform","link":"http://scripting.com/2024/04/19/015541.html?title=wordpressAsThePlatform","date":1713578141000,"content":"<p><img src=\"https://imgs.scripting.com/2022/03/21/beetle.png\" />More and more I'm getting used to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordPress\">WordPress</a> as the platform I develop for. </p>\n<p>Imagine if you, as a developer, could add your own data to a WordPress post. Then you could build editors that work at a higher level. For example, you'd keep the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2022/08/25/210902.html?title=markdownIsJustEnoughHtml\">Markdown</a> source for the page. When it was saved the system would re-render the Markdown, turning it into HTML, but you'd still have the Markdown around for editing. And of course there are other kinds of editors that make sense, knowing that the output is going to the web, but you don't have to <i>write</i> in the technical language of the web. You might want something more suited to wordsmiths -- ie <i>writers, </i>if you are a writer. I have that working here, and have been building on it.</p>\n<p>I've gone back to <a href=\"https://this.how/radio/screenshots.opml?permalink=20240219144035\">Radio UserLand</a> and tried to extrapolate, where would we have gone with that product, 22 years later. And now I'm beginning to see in the pieces that are forming the new product I've been working on, something whole, something that works. </p>\n<p>I think of it as \"WordPress For One\" -- you might be writing as part of a larger site, but this is <i>your</i> writing space, a place you can mold to fit your style, where it gets more comfortable over the years, more you. That's what I've felt has been wrong with the direction the web has been going in, we're getting <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2024/01/14/031201.html\">boxed</a> into smaller and smaller spaces, but for some of my writing I want a nice stage with good lighting and full freedom to tell a story that I have to tell, not necessarily all at once, but possibly in a series, over time. </p>\n<p>I also want to be influenced by your story. I want <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2024/04/16/140810.html\">Working Together</a>. </p>\n<p>Of course I still very much develop for <a href=\"https://feedland.com/\">FeedLand</a>, and in the back of my mind I want to loop back around to <a href=\"http://drummer.land/\">Drummer</a> (it's my main writing environment), and then I have another product I call Belter I want to finish. And I wouldn't mind trying to make a CSS thing that makes more sense than the tragedy CSS is, and also would love to see a port of <a href=\"http://frontier.userland.com\">Frontier</a> to Linux, though I don't see doing that myself, but I would like to guide it (so it runs all the old stuff first). </p>","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"5fc326d0b4647f54b0aafeb2c39f914eef350da4b249eec906ba7576bf7d3724","category":"default"}
