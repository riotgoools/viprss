Amazon is coming out with a full-color e-reader called <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0CN3XR57P/ref=nosim/0sil8\">the Kindle Colorsoft</a>. You can <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0CN3XR57P/ref=nosim/0sil8\">pre-order it now for $280</a> and it ships on October 30. This will be great for comics, graphic novels, and books with art &amp; photography. I am a committed ebook reader and itâ€™s always been disappointing to view photos on the Kindleâ€¦they look like they were faxed from the Voyager space probe or something.</p>\n\n<p>As it happens, Iâ€™m in the market for a new e-reader â€” I lost my Kindle Paperwhite a few weeks ago and havenâ€™t replaced it (partially because Iâ€™m in the midst of an actual paper book right now but mostly because I am stubbon and donâ€™t want to believe I have become the sort of person who loses things â€” my driverâ€™s license also went missing recently). Anyway, Iâ€™m trying to decide between the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0CN3XR57P/ref=nosim/0sil8\">Colorsoft</a> ($280), <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0CHF746JZ/ref=nosim/0sil8\">the Boox Palma</a> (aka <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/05/the-gentle-librarian\">the Gentle Librarian</a>, also $280), or getting <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0CFPJYX7P/ref=nosim/0sil8\">the new &amp; improved Paperwhite</a> (faster, bigger screen, thinner, higher contrast, $160). Hmmâ€¦</p>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Amazon\">Amazon</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Boox\">Boox</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Kindle\">Kindle</a></p>\n\n         <p>ðŸ’¬ <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/10/ooh-a-color-kindle-is-finally-here\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> â†’</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"26f368eeac220ef6cd24e7d7620e881d3db493fff550c127bec961e6cadbfd48","category":"Sites"}
