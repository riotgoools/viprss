{"title":"Cross-posting in 2024","link":"http://scripting.com/2024/05/06/135847.html?title=crosspostingIn2024","date":1715003927000,"content":"<p>Some pragmatic notes how cross-posting works these days.</p>\n<p>I use regularly: Twitter, Threads, Facebook, Mastodon, Bluesky.  </p>\n<p>Two that have APIs I can use: Mastodon and Bluesky.</p>\n<p>I can't send images to Bluesky via their API, they broke the interface. My way of doing it is now called \"legacy.\" The app that uses that feature doesn't work. But I don't even remotely have the time to go back and fix it.</p>\n<p>The items in my <a href=\"http://scripting.com/?tab=links\">linkblog</a> come from this flow. If it appears in my linkblog, it also appears on Masto and Bluesky.</p>\n<p>When I want broader distribution, I do this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Open a new browser window.</li>\n<li>Open a tab to Twitter usually. I don't know why.</li>\n<li>I write some text into the Twitter tab.  </li>\n<li>Paste an image if there is one.</li>\n<li>I open another tab for Threads, Facebook, Mastodon, Bluesky. </li>\n<li>I make one pass to paste the text, another to paste the image.</li>\n<li>I click Send in each of the tabs, and get back to what I was doing.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I'm sure a lot of people are doing something very much like this. I can actually witness Jeff Jarvis doing it. I think Jay Rosen probably is too.</p>\n<p>One thing that Bluesky may not be aware of is that their character limit is signficantly lower than the others, so sometimes I can't include them in this rotation. </p>\n<p>I'd love to see one of these support the features of <a href=\"https://textcasting.org/\">textcasting</a>. I would give them 100 good netizen points for that, because it wouldn't be long before the others did it, and we'd have a much more complete network writing environment. </p>","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"47ded64b51977dde2e8b1439715626a5ec9a924a421650daf60d00dda1b05c5f","category":"default"}
