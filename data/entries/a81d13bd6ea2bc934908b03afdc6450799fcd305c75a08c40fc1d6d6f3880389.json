{"title":"98-Year-Old Dick Van Dyke Stars in Lovely New Coldplay Video","link":"https://kottke.org/24/12/dick-van-dyke-coldplay-video","date":1733508567000,"content":"\n        <p></p>\n\n<p>Coldplay tapped Spike Jonze &amp; Mary Wigmore to direct the music video for a song called All My Love from <a href=\"https://coldplay.lnk.to/MoonMusic\">their latest album</a> and the pair decided to turn it into an early 99th birthday celebration of Dick Van Dyke. Van Dyke danced a bit, sung a bit, was swarmed by his family, and ruminated on nearing the end of his life:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>Iâ€™m acutely aware that I could go any day now, but I donâ€™t know why it doesnâ€™t concern me. Iâ€™m not afraid of it. I have the feeling â€” totally against anything intellectual I have â€” that Iâ€™m gonna be alright.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>The video is really quite moving â€” what a splendid human. Watch until the end, when Chris Martin composes a song on the spot for an absolutely delighted Van Dyke.
