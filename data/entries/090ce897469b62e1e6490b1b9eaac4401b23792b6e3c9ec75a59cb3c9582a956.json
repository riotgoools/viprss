Here are some of my favorites:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>3. Walz credits his rural upbringing for <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/02/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-tim-walz.html\">his values</a>: “A town that small had services like that and had a public school with a government teacher that inspired me to be sitting where I’m at today. Those are real stories in small towns.”</p>\n\n<p>6. Walz’s father, a school administrator, died of lung cancer when Walz was 19. Walz said this moment fueled his views on health care access: “The last week of my dad’s life cost my mom a decade of going back to work to pay off hospital debt.”</p>\n\n<p>9. He still <a href=\"https://www.startribune.com/dog-parks-diet-dew-and-car-sickness-a-collection-of-tidbits-about-gov-tim-walz/600766873\">speaks Mandarin</a>.</p>\n\n<p>15. He was the <a href=\"https://www.startribune.com/tim-walz-s-campaign-for-minnesota-governor-aims-to-bridge-the-great-divide/495297961\">faculty adviser</a> for [Mankato West High School’s] first gay-straight alliance chapter in 1999.</p>\n\n<p>24. Walz won re-election five times in southern Minnesota’s mostly rural, conservative 1st District, serving in the House for 12 years.</p>\n\n<p>28. Walz once earned an “A” rating from the National Rifle Association and the group’s endorsement. In 2016, Guns &amp; Ammo magazine included him <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/01/us/nra-tim-walz-guns.html#:~:text=Early%20in%20his%20political%20career,gave%20him%20an%20A%20rating.\">on its list</a> of top 20 politicians for gun owners.</p>\n\n<p>29. He later denounced the NRA and supported gun-control measures, such as an assault weapons ban. During his first campaign for governor in 2018, the NRA completely downgraded his rating. “I had an A rating from the NRA. Now I get straight F’s. And I sleep just fine.”</p>\n\n<p>33. Walz frequently defends his policies, such as the <a href=\"https://www.mprnews.org/story/2023/03/17/gov-signs-universal-school-meals-bill-into-law\">universal school meals bill</a> signed into Minnesota law earlier this year, as common sense: “What a monster! Kids are eating and having full bellies so they can go learn and women are making their own healthcare decisions,” Walz <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/03/who-is-tim-walz-potential-vp-kamala-harris\">said jokingly</a>.</p>\n\n<p>51. His tater tot hot dish - the unofficial dish of Minnesota - is three time champion of <a href=\"https://www.startribune.com/gov-tim-walzs-hot-dish-tweet-might-be-his-most-controversial-message-of-the-year/600134778\">the Minnesota Congressional Delegation Hot Dish Off</a>. He won in 2013, 2014 and 2016.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/02/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-tim-walz.html?unlocked_article_code=1.BE4.lkac.0-EXO0exE24F\">Ezra Klein’s interview with Walz</a> (pre-VP pick) is well worth a listen. Here’s an exchange near the end of the interview:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>Klein: If a Democrat is president in 2025 and there’s a governing trifecta, what do you think Democrats should pass first? What would make the biggest difference for people?</p>\n\n<p>Walz: I think paid family and medical leave. We’re the last nation on earth basically to not do this. It is so foundational to just basic decency and financial well-being. And I think that would start to change both finances, attitude — strengthen the family.</p>\n\n<p>If JD Vance is right about this: that we should make it easier for families to be together, then make sure that after your child’s born, that you can spend a little time with them. That’d be a great thing.</p>\n\n<p>K: Great way of also seeing who in politics is actually pro-family and who just likes to talk about it.</p>\n\n<p>W: Oh, it separates people quickly.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>He also reiterated <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/06/tim-walz-vp-beliefs-policies-record\">this point</a> in the interview:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>“Right now, Minnesota is showing the country you don’t win elections to bank political capital,” Walz said last year. “You win elections to burn political capital and improve lives.”</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Reading that quote, I immediately thought of Lyndon Johnson and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Society\">Great Society</a>; there’s <a href=\"https://beta.prx.org/stories/306399\">a great podcast series</a> about it hosted by Melody Barnes.</p>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Anusha%20Mathur\">Anusha Mathur</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/lists\">lists</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/politics\">politics</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Tim%20Walz\">Tim Walz</a></p>\n\n         <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/08/55-things-to-know-about-tim-walz\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"090ce897469b62e1e6490b1b9eaac4401b23792b6e3c9ec75a59cb3c9582a956","category":"default"}
