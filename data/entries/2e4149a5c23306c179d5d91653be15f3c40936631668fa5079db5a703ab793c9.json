That was an increase from September’s 149.4 million calls per day and 1,729 per second. (<a href=\"https://www.telecompetitor.com/robocall-research-sees-decline-for-2024-despite-october-increase/\" target=\"_blank\">Link</a>)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>AI is the hot new thing. AI companies (or the ones that call themselves AI companies) have raised $18.9 billion in Q3 2024, or about 28 percent of all venture funding, as per <a href=\"https://news.crunchbase.com/venture/global-startup-funding-recap-q3-2024/\" target=\"_blank\">Crunchbase data</a>. OpenAI alone raised $6.6 billion.

We’ve been adding over a million users per day for the last few days.” (<a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/jay.bsky.team/post/3lbd2eaura22r\" target=\"_blank\">Link</a>) </li>\n\n\n\n<li>21% of Americans (37% of under-30s) regularly get news from news influencers. Most operate independently (77%) of traditional news organizations. Yup, we saw that during this election cycle.

A wonderful long read about the internet, cables, and infrastructure. (Nautilus)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>What is Art in the Age of AI? And what is the role of the artist in the age of AI? A great long <a href=\"https://bwvision.com/art-the-artist-and-ai/?__readwiseLocation=\" target=\"_blank\">essay by photographer Joel Tjintjelaar.</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li>My former colleague Laura Owen, editor at Nieman Lab, is eschewing social media and has come up with a new way to deal with post-social reality for consuming news and information. This is very good.
