Which covers the bulk of the <a href=\"https://interactive.aljazeera.com/aje/2021/the-arab-spring-retweeted-10-years/index.html?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=president-yoon-s-massive-l\" target=\"_blank\">Arab Spring</a>, the London riots, the start and end of Occupy Wall Street, and the week that Hurricane Sandy rolled into New York City. None of these events were caused by Twitter, but our understanding of them was wholly shaped by the tweets we viewed them through.</p><p>And the question <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/bencollins.bsky.social/post/3lcgifsl2hs2m?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=president-yoon-s-massive-l\" target=\"_blank\">many</a> are <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/scoiattolo.mountainherder.xyz/post/3lcgcjaos6k2b?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=president-yoon-s-massive-l\" target=\"_blank\">asking</a> right now is whether or not this week’s failed coup attempt in South Korea was similarly defining for Bluesky. I don’t think so, but it was definitely the platform’s first real test at handling something like this and I do think it passed.</p><p>On Tuesday night, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-yoon-martial-law-25a2a7c957e77a19f771b6b7c56a2173?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=president-yoon-s-massive-l\" target=\"_blank\">declared martial law</a>. The military swarmed the country’s parliament and clashed with protesters and even lawmakers, who had to effectively break into the building to vote down the resolution. If you’re looking for a greatest hits from the protests that followed Yoon’s attempted coup, here’s <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/adamjschwarz.bsky.social/post/3lcg46lagl22d?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=president-yoon-s-massive-l\" target=\"_blank\">a video</a> of Lee Jae-myung, the leader of the Korean Democratic Party, livestreaming himself scaling a wall of a military barricade, <a href=\"https://x.com/IwriteOK/status/1864149108996624558?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=president-yoon-s-massive-l\" target=\"_blank\">another video</a> of a riot cop getting spun around by a protester lol, and a <a href=\"https://x.com/alexcmhwee/status/1864165067245408721?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=president-yoon-s-massive-l\" target=\"_blank\">video</a> of Democratic Party spokesperson Ahn Gwi-ryeong seizing a cop’s gun and scolding him like a big dumb baby.</p><p>A brief aside here, I spent about six weeks following anti-Olympic protesters around South Korea during the 2018 Winter Olympics and I think it’s important for Americans to understand that protest dynamics are a bit different in Korea. Korean men <a href=\"https://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20230823000500&amp;utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=president-yoon-s-massive-l\" target=\"_blank\">can serve</a> as police officers instead of being conscripted into the military at 18, so it’s not uncommon to see, basically, teenage boys in riot gear getting absolutely walloped by middle-aged protesters.</p><p>Anyways, the coup failed, thankfully, and Yoon is <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8rjd064012o?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=president-yoon-s-massive-l\" target=\"_blank\">facing impeachment</a> for \"insurrectionary behavior.” And while I hesitate to hold up this whole episode as some kind of omen of what’s to come for America — because Korean politics could not be more different than ours and, technically, we already had our insurrection and, in my opinion, it succeeded — it is worth noting that Yoon came to power two years ago amid a huge <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-60643446?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=president-yoon-s-massive-l\" target=\"_blank\">wave of misogyny</a> and backlash against <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/15/4b-south-korea-feminist-movement-donald-trump-election-backlash?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=president-yoon-s-massive-l\" target=\"_blank\">Korea’s feminist 4b movement</a>.</p><div><img src=\"https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/287dd73f-62ed-4f9e-be15-a0f406869bc2/Screenshot_2024-12-04_at_11.08.08_AM.png?t=1733328506\" /><div><span><p>(<a href=\"https://x.com/beatrizgietner/status/1864006417897701870?s=12&amp;utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=president-yoon-s-massive-l\" target=\"_blank\">x.com/beatrizgietner</a>)</p></span></div></div><p>Over on Bluesky, as Yoon was taking a massive L, the star of the moment was <i>Verge</i> reporter Sarah Jeong, who happened to be drinking in Seoul nearby and proceeded to drunkenly live-skeet the insurrection. What an incredible sequence of words. You can spin through Jeong’s <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/sarahjeong.bsky.social?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=president-yoon-s-massive-l\" target=\"_blank\">Bluesky posts here</a>, they’re great. She was also nice enough to blog the evening over <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24312920/martial-law-south-korea-yoon-suk-yeol-protest-dispatch?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=president-yoon-s-massive-l\" target=\"_blank\">on </a><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24312920/martial-law-south-korea-yoon-suk-yeol-protest-dispatch?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=president-yoon-s-massive-l\" target=\"_blank\"><i>The Verge</i></a><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24312920/martial-law-south-korea-yoon-suk-yeol-protest-dispatch?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=president-yoon-s-massive-l\" target=\"_blank\"> the website</a>.</p><p>But aside from Jeong’s serendipitous reporting, how did Bluesky do with its first big news story? Well, <i>Yonhap</i>, Korea’s biggest news agency, is not on the platform. So that definitely affected things a bit. There also still aren’t a lot of Koreans on Bluesky. By share of users, Bluesky is <a href=\"https://www.creatosaurus.io/blog/bluesky-social-statistics?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=president-yoon-s-massive-l\" target=\"_blank\">overwhelmingly Brazilian</a>, with the US, Singapore, and Japan coming in second, third, and fourth, respectively. There was <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/sada0w0.bsky.social/post/3lcg22aze5c2o?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=president-yoon-s-massive-l\" target=\"_blank\">some local activity</a> going viral on the platform yesterday, but it was nowhere close to the kind of open source investigation, or OSINT, that we used to expect from Twitter.</p><p>The bigger issue, though, when it comes to relying on Bluesky during a news event like this, is the platform’s video player. Unfortunately, we have come a long way from the still images and GIFs that defined the news stories that made Twitter, Twitter. Video is now a fundamental part of the grammar of breaking news online and Bluesky’s video player is <a href=\"https://bsky.social/about/blog/09-11-2024-video?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=president-yoon-s-massive-l\" target=\"_blank\">currently limited</a> to 60 seconds, capped at a low resolution, and limits users to only 25 video uploads a day. In other words, it’s got a ways to go still.</p><p>But the very last issue with the overall experience of using Bluesky for breaking news is that it’s still not a place where people are making and sharing cultural commentary that can turn Bluesky into a destination. And this is an issue I have noticed about Bluesky, in general, actually. My assumption is that this is a side effect of how old Bluesky users tend to be. Which may be related to the limits of the platform’s video support. (The only thing zoomers seem to read are memes.) But it might also be connected to Bluesky’s anti-Twitter beginnings. The power users still don’t want that kind of culture. Regardless of why, all of the Good Posts I’ve seen about the Korean coup attempt — memes, viral takes, popular clips from the protests — were actually over on X. And even if you scroll through this <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:45pxy4qgho73i5j2jkvae2qh/feed/aaapjmiwz5sky?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=president-yoon-s-massive-l\" target=\"_blank\">handy custom feed</a> for viral Bluesky posts, you’re not going to see much. And what you do find there is a bunch of <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/keithedwards.bsky.social/post/3lchl5slrjs2y?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=president-yoon-s-massive-l\" target=\"_blank\">#Resistance cringe</a>.</p><p>Now, I need to acknowledge that I’m being hard on Bluesky. I realize how difficult of a job the platform has ahead of it. It’s trying to defeat the corpse of Twitter and also fend off Meta Snapchat-ing it for parts to feed to Threads. And I’m being hard on it because we need it to win that two-front war. It is the only good option we have here. And yesterday was an important proof of concept for breaking news on Bluesky. We know it can work there. Which makes me think we’re a lot closer to the platform’s big breakthrough moment than many expect.</p><p>Though, who knows, we still haven’t seen how Threads has reacted to the coup. When users over there learn about it in a day or two maybe they’ll have a good take on it.</p><hr /><p><i>The following is a paid ad.

Several big names in the AI industry have started admitting that they have reached a plateau with how smart and effective these models can be. <i>Reuters</i> <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/openai-rivals-seek-new-path-smarter-ai-current-methods-hit-limitations-2024-11-11/?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=president-yoon-s-massive-l\" target=\"_blank\">has some more</a> on this. </p><p>Now I will say, this isn’t exactly surprising.
