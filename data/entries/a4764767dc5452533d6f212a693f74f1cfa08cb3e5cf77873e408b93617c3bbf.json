And the Riot Goools mint began on October 6, 2021, the day after my first tweet.) I don't really know what to write for an occasion like this. I don't think I expected this thing to last so long. When I started, I didn't have any expectations at all. I was literally starting from zero and just wanted to experiment and learn and share art and ideas with people. It still feels like a strange year-long dream. Like one of those dreams where you're constantly meeting and connecting with random strangers and characters. One where the logic of the world is a little bit skewed but you don't question it. It's the kind of dream that keeps you tossing and turning all night and leaves you even more exhausted afterwards.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://mirror.xyz/riotgoools.eth/A19K079rSslYAD-cUOEi76agQRwndVDQ7l6W6diww1w\">Read the full entry</a></p>\n","author":"elle","siteTitle":"elle","siteHash":"7e5129fe3f5513780be522d901263accb61be79b3a0e9bbe44e73d0e66dada6d","entryHash":"a4764767dc5452533d6f212a693f74f1cfa08cb3e5cf77873e408b93617c3bbf","category":"Sites"}
