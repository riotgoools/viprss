{"title":"Venezuela under “Brutal Capitalism”","link":"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/902030453/0/marginalrevolution~Venezuela-under-Brutal-Capitalism.html","date":1722337858000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://x.com/jeffreypclemens/status/1817911013314052429\">Jeffrey Clemens</a> points us to some bonkers editorializing in the <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/28/world/americas/venezuela-election-results.html\">NYTimes coverage</a> of the likely stolen election in Venezuela. The piece starts out reasonably enough:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Venezuela’s authoritarian leader, Nicolás Maduro, was declared the winner of the country’s tumultuous presidential election early Monday, despite enormous momentum from an opposition movement that had been convinced this was the year it would oust Mr. Maduro’s socialist-inspired party.</p>\r\n<p>The vote was riddled with irregularities, and citizens were angrily protesting the government’s actions at voting centers even as the results were announced.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>The term “socialist-inspired party” is peculiar. The party in question is the <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Socialist_Party_of_Venezuela\">United Socialist Party of Venezuela</a> (<i>Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela) </i>and it’s founding principles state, “<span>The party is constituted as a socialist party, and affirms that a socialist society is the only alternative to overcome the capitalist system.” So, I would have gone with ‘Mr. Maduro’s socialist party’. No matter, that’s not the big blunder. Later the piece says:</span></p>\r\n<blockquote><p>If the election decision holds and Mr. Maduro remains in power, he will carry Chavismo, the country’s socialist-inspired movement, into its third decade in Venezuela. Founded by former President Hugo Chávez, Mr. Maduro’s mentor, the movement initially promised to lift millions out of poverty.</p>\r\n<p>For a time it did. But in recent years, the socialist model has given way to brutal capitalism, economists say, with a small state-connected minority <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/01/world/americas/Venezuela-economy-dollars.html\">controlling much of the nation’s wealth</a>.</p></blockquote>\r\n<p>Venezuela is now governed by “brutal capitalism” under Maduro’s United Socialist Party!??? The NYTimes has lost touch with reality. From the link we find that what they mean is that some price and wage controls were lifted, including allowing dollars to be used because the bolívar, was “made worthless by hyperinflation,” and remittances from the United States were legalized:</p>\r\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/01/world/americas/Venezuela-economy-dollars.html\">NYTimes</a>: With the country’s economy derailed by years of mismanagement and corruption, then pushed to the brink of collapse by American sanctions, Mr. Maduro was forced to relax the economic restraints that once defined his socialist government and provided the foundation for his political legitimacy.</p></blockquote>\r\n<p>Lifting some controls does not make Venezuela a capitalist country. Moreover, the lifting of controls led to improvements:</p>\r\n<blockquote><p>…Seeing shelves stocked again has also helped ease tensions in the capital, where anger over the lack of <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/30/world/americas/venezuela-students-hunger.html\">basic necessities</a> has, over the years, helped fuel <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/22/world/americas/venezuela-protests-maduro.html\">mass protests</a>.</p>\r\n<p>…The transformation also brought some relief to the millions of Venezuelans who have family abroad and can now receive, and spend, their dollar remittances on imported food.</p></blockquote>\r\n<p>Of course, the improvements were not equally shared. If you want to call unequal improvements, “brutal capitalism”. Well, I don’t think that’s useful but if you do so be sure to note that “under Maduro’s administration, more than 20,000 people have been subject to extrajudicial killings and <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuelan_refugee_crisis\">seven million Venezuelans</a> have been forced to flee the country.” (<a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicol%C3%A1s_Maduro\">Wikipedia</a>.) That’s brutal socialism.</p>\r\n<p>Lastly, I don’t expect, the NYTimes to keep up on the latest counter-factual estimation techniques so I won’t ding them too much, but it’s clear that the Chavismo regime never lifted millions out of poverty. At best, <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167268116000020\">poverty fell during the good years at the rate one would have expected</a> from looking at similar countries. It’s the later rise in poverty which is unprecedented, as the NYTimes <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/17/world/americas/venezuela-economy.html\">previously acknowledged</a>.</p>\r\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/07/venezuela-under-brutal-capitalism.html\">Venezuela under “Brutal Capitalism”</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com\">Marginal REVOLUTION</a>.</p>\r\n<img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/902030453/0/marginalrevolution\" />\r\n<div><a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/902030453/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/902030453/marginalrevolution,\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/902030453/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/x.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/902030453/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/902030453/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/07/venezuela-under-brutal-capitalism.html#comments\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/comments20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/07/venezuela-under-brutal-capitalism.html/feed\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/commentsrss20.png\" /></a> \r\n<div><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/07/venezuela-under-brutal-capitalism.html#comments\"><h3>Comments</h3></a><ul><li><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/07/venezuela-under-brutal-capitalism.html#comment-160789620\">First comment is “it wasn't real socialism!” Amazing.</a> <i>by Sean</i></li><li><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/07/venezuela-under-brutal-capitalism.html#comment-160789619\">Alex.
