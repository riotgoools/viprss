But the grueling hours and workload eventually weighed on her physical and mental state and she fell ill, which turned out to be a blessing in disguise.</p>\n\n<p>Enyaâ€™s doctor advised her to take some time off, and find a place where she can relax and warm her body. Thatâ€™s how she discovered Kosugiyu, her local sento in Koenji. She quickly fell in love with her local hotbath and not only started working there but also began employing her architectural rendering skills to create illustrations of the space. Soon, others began asking her to draw their hotbaths as well and her clientele expanded from sento and even spread to kissaten.</p></blockquote>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/architecture\">architecture</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Enya%20Honami\">Enya Honami</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/illustration\">illustration</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Japan\">Japan</a></p>\n\n         <p>ðŸ’¬ <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/08/isometric-drawings-of-japanese-bathhouses-and-cafes\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> â†’</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"a8a736c4e14da047cf7717f2151986c8d3459cd7d9da545348c4c3d609c69353","category":"default"}
