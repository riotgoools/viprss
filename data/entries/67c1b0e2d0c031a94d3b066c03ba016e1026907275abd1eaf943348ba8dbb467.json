Please listen to the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2024/06/23/howRssStartedTheRealStory.m4a\">14-minute podcast</a> I <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2024/06/23.html#a201841\">posted</a> yesterday for the real story. We should learn from this and not repeat the same mistake, and of course until the real story is out there, we can't learn from it. Let's get it right on the Wikipedia page.
