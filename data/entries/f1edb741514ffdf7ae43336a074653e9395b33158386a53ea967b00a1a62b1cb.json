{"title":"India’s Cities","link":"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/902899214/0/marginalrevolution~Indias-Cities.html","date":1723720743000,"content":"<p>The Economist has a <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.economist.com/asia/2024/08/01/indian-cities-are-utterly-unprepared-for-what-is-about-to-hit-them\">good piece</a> on India’s cities. Mumbai has done a great job in recent years at building more infrastructure but infrastructure alone is not enough:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>…An overly prescriptive, 2,200-page National Building Code and a surfeit of local rules prevent developers from making optimal use of pricey urban land. Mumbai has some of the most restrictive land-use regulations of any global megacity. In most well-functioning cities about 90% of land is given over to streets, public spaces and buildings. In Mumbai and other Indian cities, those uses take up less than half of the land area, according to analysis by Bimal Patel, an urban planner. The rest is wasted on “private open spaces”—mostly building compounds that are walled off and put to no good use.</p>\r\n<p>The result is that Indian cities are sparsely built-up yet feel densely crowded, note Sanjeev Sanyal and Aakanksha Arora of the prime minister’s Economic Advisory Council. Cities sprawl outwards, driving up the cost of providing infrastructure.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>The Economist misses, however, that to truly solve the problem what is needed is better institutions including private cities. Here’s Shruti Rajagopalan and myself <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/17/opinion/designing-private-cities-open-to-all.html\">writing in the NYTimes</a>:</p>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>If China shows the costs of too much top-down planning, India shows the costs of too little. Indian urban development has suffered under an imposing edifice of overlapping bureaucracies and a philosophy of economics that prioritizes village life over urbanization. Together, Nehruvian bureaucracy and Gandhian economics, romanticizing rural agrarian life, have made it extremely costly to convert rural land for urban use. Indian urban development has lagged that of China, and the pressures for urbanization have resulted in the unofficial building of slums and illegal and chaotic development in large cities.</p>\r\n<p>Gurgaon, a city southwest of New Delhi, is an exception. Gurgaon was a small town 25 years ago, but today it’s a city of some two million people filled with skyscrapers, luxury apartment towers, golf courses, five-star hotels and shopping malls. Often called “the Singapore of India,” Gurgaon is home to offices for nearly half the Fortune 500 firms.</p>\r\n<p>Gurgaon, however, grew not by plan but in a fit of absence of mind. After the state of Haryana streamlined the licensing process, it left developers in Gurgaon to their own devices with little intervention from any national, state or local government. As a result, almost everything that works in Gurgaon today is private. Security, for example, is privately provided for almost all housing, shopping and technology complexes. Over all, about 35,000 private security guards protect Gurgaon, compared with just 4,000 public officers. Gurgaon also has India’s only private fire department, filling an important gap, because it must be capable of reaching Gurgaon’s tallest skyscrapers.</p>\r\n<p><span>But not all is well. No developer in Gurgaon was large enough to plan for citywide services for sewage, water or electricity. For a price, private companies provide these, but in inefficient ways. </span><a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/Citys-sewage-system-stinks/articleshow/12139689.cms\" target=\"_blank\">Sewage</a><span> doesn’t flow to a central treatment plant but is often collected in trucks and then dumped on public land. Tap water is often delivered by private trucks or from illegally pumped groundwater. Reliable electricity is available 24 hours a day, but often using highly polluting diesel generators.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Compared with the rest of India, Gurgaon fares well but its functioning is far from ideal. Is there a middle ground between China’s ghost cities and the anarchy of Gurgaon? Surprisingly, privately planned cities may be an answer. And one of the oldest is in India.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jamshedpur was </span><a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~www.tatasteel.com/corporate/heritage/a-century-of-trust.asp\" target=\"_blank\">founded</a><span> by Tata Steel, as a company town, in 1908. It has landscaped parks, paved roads and even a lake, but it’s no playground for the rich. It’s a working town. Nevertheless, it is the only city in the state of Jharkhand with a sewage treatment plant, and it’s one of the few cities in all of India where residents enjoy reasonably priced, reliable electricity and safe tap water. In a </span><a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~www.dailypioneer.com/state-editions/ranchi/jamshedpur-ranks-2nd-in-quality-of-life-survey.html\" target=\"_blank\">survey</a><span> by the marketing research company Nielsen, residents ranked the city among the best in India for its cheap and reliable provision of sewage, water, electricity, public sanitation and roads.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jamshedpur works because Tata owned enough land so that it had the right incentives to plan and invest in citywide infrastructure. Tata has also had to maintain good services in order to attract workers. In Gurgaon, private developers built lots of infrastructure, but only up to the property line. By extending the property line to city-scale, the incentives to build large-scale infrastructure like sewage, water and electricity plants are also extended.</span></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p>See also <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://mason.gmu.edu/~atabarro/Lessons%20from%20Gurgaon.pdf\">Lessons from Gurgaon: India’s Private City</a> and my MRU video<a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://youtu.be/lWg2bgJPakM?si=6hZDTXrzu4WAARAp\"> Skyscrapers and Slums: What’s Driving Mumbai’s Housing Crisis?</a></p>\r\n<p>Hat tip: Salim Furth.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/08/indias-cities.html\">India’s Cities</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com\">Marginal REVOLUTION</a>.</p>\r\n<img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/902899214/0/marginalrevolution\" />\r\n<div><a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/902899214/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/902899214/marginalrevolution,\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/902899214/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/x.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/902899214/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/902899214/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/08/indias-cities.html#comments\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/comments20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/08/indias-cities.html/feed\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/commentsrss20.png\" /></a> \r\n<div><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/08/indias-cities.html#comments\"><h3>Comments</h3></a><ul><li><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/08/indias-cities.html#comment-160797649\">In reply to M.
