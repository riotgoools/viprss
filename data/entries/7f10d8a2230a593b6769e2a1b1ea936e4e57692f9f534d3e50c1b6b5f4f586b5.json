Such moments come most readily at the beginning of something new. </p>\n<p>To begin anything — a new practice, a new project, a new love — is to cast upon yourself a spell against stagnation. Beginnings are notation for the symphony of the possible in us. They ask us to break the pattern of our lives and reconfigure it afresh — something that can only be done with great courage and great tenderness, for no territory of life exposes both our power and our vulnerability more brightly than a beginning. </p>\n<figure><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/we-found-our-own-o-my-soul-in-the-calm-and-cool-of-the-daybreak_framed-print?sku=s6-8967204p21a12v52a13v54?curator=brainpicker\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/margaretcook_leavesofgrass1.jpg?resize=680%2C883&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"680\" height=\"883\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/margaretcook_leavesofgrass1.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/margaretcook_leavesofgrass1.jpg?resize=240%2C312&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/margaretcook_leavesofgrass1.jpg?resize=320%2C415&amp;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/margaretcook_leavesofgrass1.jpg?resize=768%2C997&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/margaretcook_leavesofgrass1.jpg?resize=600%2C779&amp;ssl=1 600w\" /></a><figcaption>One of English artist Margaret C.

The mountains seem to waver as though they were huge dark ships on a distant voyage. I love to climb up into the silence of these vast autonomous structures. What seems like a pinnacled summit from beneath becomes a level plateau when you arrive there. Born in a red explosion of ascending fire, the granite lies cold, barely marked by the millions of years of rain and wind. On this primeval ground I feel I have entered into a pristine permanence, a continuity here that knew the wind hundreds of millions of years before a human face ever felt it. </p>\n<p>When we arrive into the world, we enter this ancient sequence. All our beginnings happen within this continuity. Beginnings often frighten us because they seem like lonely voyages into the unknown. Yet, in truth, no beginning is empty or isolated. We seem to think that beginning is setting out from a lonely point along some line of direction into the unknown. This is not the case. Shelter and energy come alive when a beginning is embraced… We are never as alone in our beginnings as it might seem at the time. A beginning is ultimately an invitation to open toward the gifts and growth that are stored up for us. To refuse to begin can be an act of great self-neglect.</p>\n<p>[…]</p>\n<p>Our very life here depends directly on continuous acts of beginning.</p></blockquote>\n<figure><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/wanderer-above-the-sea-of-fog-der-wanderer-uber-dem-nebelmeer-by-caspar-david-friedrich-circa-1817_print?curator=brainpicker\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Friedrich_Wanderer.jpg?resize=680%2C872&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"680\" height=\"872\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Friedrich_Wanderer.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Friedrich_Wanderer.jpg?resize=320%2C410&amp;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Friedrich_Wanderer.jpg?resize=600%2C770&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Friedrich_Wanderer.jpg?resize=240%2C308&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Friedrich_Wanderer.jpg?resize=768%2C985&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Friedrich_Wanderer.jpg?resize=1198%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 1198w\" /></a><figcaption><em>Wanderer above the Sea of Fog</em> (<em>Der Wanderer über dem Nebelmeer</em>) by Caspar David Friedrich, circa 1817.

Risk might be our greatest ally. To live a truly creative life, we always need to cast a critical look at where we presently are, attempting always to discern where we have become stagnant and where new beginning might be ripening. There can be no growth if we do not remain open and vulnerable to what is new and different. I have never seen anyone take a risk for growth that was not rewarded a thousand times over.</p></blockquote>\n<figure><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/art-by-dorothy-lathrop-for-down-adown-derry-by-walter-de-la-mare-19224642772_print?curator=brainpicker\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/downadownderry_dorothylathrop17.jpg?resize=680%2C801&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"680\" height=\"801\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/downadownderry_dorothylathrop17.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/downadownderry_dorothylathrop17.jpg?resize=320%2C377&amp;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/downadownderry_dorothylathrop17.jpg?resize=600%2C707&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/downadownderry_dorothylathrop17.jpg?resize=240%2C283&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/downadownderry_dorothylathrop17.jpg?resize=768%2C905&amp;ssl=1 768w\" /></a><figcaption>Art by <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2021/03/09/dorothy-lathrop-down-adown-derry/\">Dorothy Lathrop</a>, 1922.

When the heart is ready for a fresh beginning, unforeseen things can emerge. And in a sense, this is exactly what a beginning does. It is an opening for surprises. Surrounding the intention and the act of beginning, there are always exciting possibilities.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Paying attention to those portals of possibility is both an act of self-respect and a reverence of life:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Part of the art of living wisely is to learn to recognize and attend to such profound openings in one’s life.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Complement with poet Pattiann Rogers’s <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2023/11/02/pattiann-rogers-homo-sapiens/\">stunning ode to our ongoing self-creation</a> and the poetic psychoanalyst Allen Wheelis on <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2023/07/04/allen-wheelis-how-people-change/\">how people change</a>, the revisit John O’Donohue on <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2015/09/21/john-odonohue-beauty-love-desire/\">why we fall in love</a>, <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2015/08/12/anam-cara-john-o-donohue-soul-friend/\">the essence of friendship</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2023/12/08/john-o-donohue-bless/\">how we bless each other</a>.</p>\n<hr /><h3>donating = loving</h3><p>For seventeen years, I have been spending hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars each month composing <em>The Marginalian</em> (which <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2021/10/22/brain-pickings-becoming-the-marginalian/\">bore the outgrown name <em>Brain Pickings</em></a> for its first fifteen years).
