{"title":"The Lowest Possible Score in Super Mario Bros","link":"https://kottke.org/24/05/the-lowest-possible-score-in-super-mario-bros-1","date":1715350010000,"content":"\n        <p>If you play carefully by not stomping enemies, not collecting coins, not eating mushrooms or flowers, and hopping on the flagpole at the very last second, you can rescue the princess in Super Mario Bros with only 500 points.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>One bit is surprisingly tricky:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>How tough is that jump in 8-1? Well, the timing of the liftoff, the duration of holding the jump button, and the timing of the wall jump are all frame perfect. NES games run at 60 frames per second, which means all the necessary inputs need to be timed within 1/60 of a second. In addition, the starting position before running I used not only has to be on the right pixel, but also the x sub-pixel has to fall within a certain range (technical stuff blah blah blah). In short, it’s a pretty annoying jump.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>When I was a kid, I left my NES on for three straight days to flip the score in SMB, using <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUx66ZEDjnQ\">the 1UP trick</a> and another spot in the game to get many lives and points. Scoring lower would have been a lot quicker.</p>\n\n         <p><em>[This is a vintage post originally from Feb 2014.]</em></p>\n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Super%20Mario%20Bros\">Super Mario Bros</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/timeless%20posts\">timeless posts</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/video\">video</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/video%20games\">video games</a></p>\n\n        \n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"be6135b28dd691dbc8592e51b7f37257f60c96ca5f41dc38d1dc074116bf72bc","category":"default"}
