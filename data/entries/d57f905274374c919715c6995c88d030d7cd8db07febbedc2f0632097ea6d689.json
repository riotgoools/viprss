In the next few months Twitter is going to morph into the political system that Barack Obama could have and should have built.</p>\n<p>It turns out creating a president of the United States is worth a lot of money. Trump is inept at squeezing the money out of it, he's a loudmouth who proved one thing, Twitter is all you needed in 2016 to get elected president. That's going to change, as competition shows up (Zuckerberg, for example, with Threads). </p>\n<p>They know, even if you don't -- that it can be very profitable to own the presidency. </p>\n<p>If Trump loses, Musk won't get it on this round, but eventually he will own a big piece of the president, and then he will move his deals with SpaceX and Tesla up a notch.</p>\n<p>Listen to the <a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/scripting.com/2024/08/15/elonMuskIsJustGettingStartedWithTwitter.m4a\">podcast</a>, it's only 11 minutes.
