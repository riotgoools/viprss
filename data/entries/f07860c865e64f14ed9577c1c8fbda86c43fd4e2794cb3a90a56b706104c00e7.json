{"title":"Road Snacks #2 â€” Jack Van Cleaf","link":"https://kottke.org/24/05/road-snacks-jack-van-cleaf","date":1714778742000,"content":"\n        <p>The second issue of Road Snacks is out featuring an interview with Nashville-based singer/songwriter <a href=\"https://www.jackvancleaf.com\">Jack Van Cleaf</a>. I like his song <a href=\"https://youtu.be/qdu-pyaWa3w?si=I8YzDz2h7eZnoPZa\">Rattlesnake</a>, maybe you will, too. Road Snacks is semi-regular interview series between an ice cream shop and a touring musician talking exclusively about food on tour. I have made it my mission to find out which snacky treats touring musicians live for.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p><strong>Jack Van Cleaf:</strong> Thatâ€™s the thing, when I get to the gas station, they only have the small bags. The price per pound ratio doesnâ€™t appeal to me as much, but when I get those big bags from Costco, I donâ€™t know, something about the endlessness of it. It really, really drives me.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Gracieâ€™s:</strong> You get lost in the bottom of bag.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Jack Van Cleaf:</strong> I do, I do. Probably at the gas station Iâ€™m gonna go with a Reeseâ€™s Cup or a Take Five.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Gracieâ€™s:</strong> Tell me anything else about food while touring?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Jack Van Cleaf:</strong> The gas station question has me thinking about Twist of Lime Hot Cheetos. Are you familiar with those?</p></blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/graciesicecre/love-yourself-779221?e=afd79cbebe\">You can read the full interview here</a>.</p>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/interviews\">interviews</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Jack%20Van%20Cleaf\">Jack Van Cleaf</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/music\">music</a></p>\n\n         <p>ðŸ’¬ <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/05/road-snacks-jack-van-cleaf\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> â†’</p>\n\n    ","author":"Aaron Cohen","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"f07860c865e64f14ed9577c1c8fbda86c43fd4e2794cb3a90a56b706104c00e7","category":"default"}
