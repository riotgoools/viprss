{"title":"The joke that changed my life","link":"https://sive.rs/joke","date":1655596800000,"content":"<p>\nGrowing up in America, I didn’t know much about other cultures.\n</p><p>\nWhen I was 25, my band got some gigs in Europe — my first time there.\nIt was 1995.\nThe European Union was new.\n<strong>\nI heard a street performer in Copenhagen tell this joke:\n</strong>\n</p><p>\n“The EU will be a success if …\n</p><ul><li>\nthe British are the police\n</li><li>\nthe French are the chefs\n</li><li>\nthe Italians are the lovers\n</li><li>\nand the whole thing is organized by the Germans.”\n</li></ul><p>\n“The EU will be a disaster if …\n</p><ul><li>\nthe British are the chefs\n</li><li>\nthe French are the police\n</li><li>\nthe Germans are the lovers\n</li><li>\nand the whole thing is organized … by the Italians.”\n</li></ul><p>\nThe European crowd all laughed.\nThey seemed to know the stereotypes in the joke.\n<strong>\nBut I was confused.\n</strong>\nI could figure out the French chef and Italian lover, but the rest were a mystery.\n</p><p>\nThat night I bothered my Danish host for hours, asking him many questions like, “Do the French have bad police? Why are the Germans supposed to be so organized?”\nHe was patient and tried to explain.\nThe stereotypes had no malice.\nIt was an affectionate tolerance, like we are with family members.\nMom always loses her keys.\nUncle burns whatever he cooks.\nMaybe it only happens sometimes, but enough to earn a reputation for it, which is enough to be teased for it.\n</p><p>\nBut how can a whole culture earn a reputation?\n<strong>\nWhy are some cultures one way, and other cultures another way?\nWhat makes millions of people in an area have similar behaviors?\n</strong>\n</p><p>\nReligion?\nA historical event that changed everyone’s actions and beliefs for a generation?\nOr is it actually just false, and based on one popular movie, like thinking all Australians are Crocodile Dundee?\n</p><p>\nThey say that America is more individualist and China is more collectivist.\nBut <em>why</em>?\nDoes the influence of cowboys or Confucius still shape everything?\nOr is that the easy-but-wrong answer?\n</p><p>\n<strong>\nI have hundreds of questions like this, and I’ve been pursuing the answers ever since\n</strong>\n— for 27 years now!\nAll because of that joke.\n</p><p>\nThe best explanations I’ve found so far are the books “<a href=\"https://sive.rs/book/AuContraire\">Au Contraire! Figuring out the French</a>” and “<a href=\"https://sive.rs/book/WatchingTheEnglish\">Watching the English</a>”.\nPlease <a href=\"https://sive.rs/contact\">let me know</a> of any other great answers.\n\n</p><figure>\n<img src=\"/images/joke.jpg\" alt=\"busker in Copenhagen\" />\n<figcaption>Photo of <a href=\"https://www.pipermckenzie.info/\">Piper Mckenzie</a> by <a href=\"https://busk.co/blog/busking-in/busking-copenhagen/\">Dawn</a>.</figcaption>\n</figure>","author":"Derek Sivers","siteTitle":"Derek Sivers","siteHash":"4098504c0d0759e13901f29e63f7d7dbb1d972a078c6dc4560660f373da5c25e","entryHash":"766d65d730563be724d69b67e92611277e2022682ca394a3cd12b993ff603857","category":"default"}
