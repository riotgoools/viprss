If one of them did, we could start curated lists of feeds put together by smart people and influencers. The first podcast client that did this would open up the market, and stand out from the pack. I've been <a href=\"http://scripting.com/stories/2012/06/29/twoSuggestionsForPodcastCl.html\">asking</a> for this from the inception of podcasting twenty years ago. I had it in my first podcatcher. It would be great if one of the popular clients of today adopted the idea. Happy to help.","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"f4f3cc5f6cd06f26be8542cea502b4dd323d718d8fb5c25f4bdeef2ece125a7c","category":"Sites"}
