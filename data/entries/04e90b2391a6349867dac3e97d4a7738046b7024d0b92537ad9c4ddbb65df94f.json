Book me or I explode! Waaaaaah!!”\nIf they like that introduction, you’ve found a good match.\n</p><p>\nSet the tone.\nPull in those people who love that kind of thing.\n<a href=\"https://sive.rs/exclude\">Proudly alienate</a> those that don’t.\n</p><p>\nThere’s a minimalist classical music composer whose emails to me are always just one provocative thought.\nLike when I posted something online about being an introvert, he emailed me just one sentence:\n“Are we not ever-changing, both gradually and per situation?”\nThat’s it.\nNo greeting or closing or manners in-between.\nHis communication style always makes me smile, and reminds me of his music.\n</p><p>\nThe gentle new-age artist always calls me “sweetie” and reminds me to nourish my soul.\n</p><p>\nThe surf-music artist always uses the Hawaiian greetings “aloha” and “mahalo” when he emails, along with other surfer slang.\n</p><p>\nThe rebellious punk never calls me by my name, but instead just says, “Hey sellout.”\n</p><p>\nBe different.\n<strong>\nShow who you are.\n</strong>\n</p><p>\nIt gives people’s lives more variety, too.\n</p>\n<img src=\"/images/reach-like-you.gif\" />","author":"Derek Sivers","siteTitle":"Derek Sivers","siteHash":"4098504c0d0759e13901f29e63f7d7dbb1d972a078c6dc4560660f373da5c25e","entryHash":"04e90b2391a6349867dac3e97d4a7738046b7024d0b92537ad9c4ddbb65df94f","category":"Sites"}
