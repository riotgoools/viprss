This just sucks.”\nI tried asking it again every day or two, but the answer was the same.\n</p><p>\nEventually, I had an epiphany.\n<strong>I actually love being wrong</strong>, even though it cracks my confidence, <strong>because that’s the only time I learn.</strong>\n<strong>I actually love being lost</strong>, even though it fuels fears, <strong>because that’s when I go somewhere unexpected.</strong>\n</p><p>\nI pursue being wrong and lost in small doses.\nI love little lessons that surprise my expectations and change my mind.\nIf we’re not surprised, we’re not learning.\n</p><p>\nSo I finally figured out what’s great about this.\nGetting knocked on my ass made me humble as hell.\nIt’d been years since I’d called for help.\nIt’d been years since I was so open to advice. \n</p><p>\nI smiled, thinking of how much I’d learned from my friends this past month.\nI realized how ultimately happy it makes me to be so empty, even if it really hurts at first.\n<strong>\nIt’s better than thinking I’ve got it all figured out.\n</strong>\n</p>","author":"Derek Sivers","siteTitle":"Derek Sivers","siteHash":"4098504c0d0759e13901f29e63f7d7dbb1d972a078c6dc4560660f373da5c25e","entryHash":"807bf70c369b0f91f13f9d161c9028237dc27ffd3d2a0d190d5a0e468001fdcd","category":"default"}
