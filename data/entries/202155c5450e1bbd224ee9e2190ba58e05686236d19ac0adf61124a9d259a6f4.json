The New York Police Department is now carrying out a manhunt to find the gunman, who is still at large. Authorities <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/nypd-releases-new-photos-man-sought-killing-unitedhealthcare-ceo-rcna183343?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=trying-to-scold-the-entire-internet\" target=\"_blank\">released</a> four, unfortunately, dazzling photos of Thompson’s seemingly very handsome masked killer, revealed that his shell casings had the words “deny,” “defend,” and “depose” carved on them, and, also, found a backpack full of Monopoly money believed to belong to the suspect. Oh, also, the hospital Thompson was sent to after the shooting <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/19/nyregion/united-healthcare-mount-sinai-hospital-deal.html?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=trying-to-scold-the-entire-internet\" target=\"_blank\">wasn’t in</a> UnitedHealthcare’s network. All of this has only added to the social media frenzy around the murder. </p><p>In fact, the overwhelming response to Thompson’s death online could be summed up as “lol, lmao even.” But it, should be noted, that it’s not just chronically online shitposters celebrating Thompson’s death. It’s possible this is the most aligned America — well, aside from the folks in its highest tax brackets — has been about a news story since the invention of the internet.</p><p>An announcement on Facebook from UnitedHealthcare had to have reaction counts <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/hayao.lol/post/3lcnxo3jf6c25?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=trying-to-scold-the-entire-internet\" target=\"_blank\">turned off</a> because of the amount of laughing emojis users were adding to it. Right-wing pundit Ben Shapiro’s viewers <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/miriambo.bsky.social/post/3lcqfn2nvh22l?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=trying-to-scold-the-entire-internet\" target=\"_blank\">were breaking rank</a> in the comments underneath a video of his about the killing. Reddit moderators <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/leading-medical-subreddit-deletes-thread-on-unitedhealthcare-ceos-murder-after-users-slam-his-record/?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=trying-to-scold-the-entire-internet\" target=\"_blank\">couldn’t contain</a> a thread about it on r/medicine. There was a <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/taliajane.bsky.social/post/3lcqdjcs3yc2i?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=trying-to-scold-the-entire-internet\" target=\"_blank\">lookalike contest</a> for Thompson’s killer in Washington Square Park over the weekend.

And there are even some <a href=\"https://x.com/moorehn/status/1866139672927195335?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=trying-to-scold-the-entire-internet\" target=\"_blank\">fun conspiracy theories</a>.</p><p>My personal favorite piece of deranged content about the killing, however, was this TikTok from <i>The Daily Mail</i>. Which isn’t a shitpost, but certainly feels like one!</p><blockquote><section><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@dailymail?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=trying-to-scold-the-entire-internet\"> @dailymail </a><p>A balloon reading ‘CEO DOWN’ and depicting a smiling star and party poppers was spotted outside the Hilton Hotel in Manhattan where United... See more</p></section></blockquote><p>Reporter Taylor Lorenz went long over in <i>User Mag</i> about about how, no, this does not mean that an overwhelming amount of the country is pro-murder, or whatever. “Thousands of Americans (myself included) are fed up with our barbaric healthcare system and the people at the top who rake in millions while inflicting pain, suffering, and death on millions of innocent people,” she <a href=\"https://www.usermag.co/p/yes-we-want-insurance-executives?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=trying-to-scold-the-entire-internet\" target=\"_blank\">wrote</a>. And <i>Today In Tabs</i>’ Rusty Foster put it another way, <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/rusty.todayintabs.com/post/3lclx5z7z6c2w?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=trying-to-scold-the-entire-internet\" target=\"_blank\">writing</a>, “A nation full of people absolutely parched for consequences and with nothing to look forward to but rising fascism.”</p><p>The only recent story like this that you can really point to is the assassination of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in 2022. His killer revealed that he carried out the attack because of Abe’s support of the Unification Church, a cult-like religious order that wields a tremendous amount of political influence in Japan. And the overwhelming response from both the Japanese public and lawmakers, alike, was, yeah, actually, <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/07/08/shinzo-abe-assassinated-obituary-japan-legacy-abenomics/?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=trying-to-scold-the-entire-internet\" target=\"_blank\">he had a point</a>. I don’t think Thompson’s murder is suddenly going to lead to the dismantling of America’s cruel and inhumane healthcare industry, but it’s certainly been a cathartic few days online.</p><p>It has also quickly unraveled a decade-plus of right-wing programming in online spaces for young men. Many of whom are suddenly realizing maybe there are meatier subjects to take their anger out on than the racial makeup of <i>Star Wars</i> casting announcements. The best example being a thread yesterday on the subreddit for the edgelord streamer Asmongold, where users were enthusiastically talking about giving up the culture war to focus on a “class war”. The thread <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/saltierthankrayt/comments/1h9voa6/rasmongold_has_a_revelation_war_erupts_in_the/?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=trying-to-scold-the-entire-internet\" target=\"_blank\">was deleted</a> eventually for being “political,” but the same conversations are happening all over the manosphere right now. Which, you know, I don’t think anyone had an anonymous assassin on their list of possible “Leftist Joe Rogan’s,” but it seems like he’s moved to the head of the pack.</p><p>As Bluesky user hayao.lol <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/hayao.lol/post/3lcuvyt53kc2d?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=trying-to-scold-the-entire-internet\" target=\"_blank\">wrote</a>, “However this ends up the guy won, flat out. This has done more damage to the image of the surveillance state, public complacency around healthcare, and 'cops' as a concept than any other single act.” Which I suspect is what’s actually making US elites so uncomfortable about all of this.</p><p>Thompson’s death been a real shock to the system for America’s ruling class, who seem to be realizing for the first time that the majority of the country will not mourn their deaths. As podcaster and reporter Michael Hobbes <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20220512195032/https://twitter.com/RottenInDenmark/status/1519199745801170944?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=trying-to-scold-the-entire-internet\" target=\"_blank\">wrote</a> a few years ago, “I think we'll look back on the last decade as a time when social media gave previously marginalized groups the ability to speak directly to elites and, as a result, elites lost their minds.” Which is why a whole bunch of tedious hall monitors are suddenly <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/06/opinion/united-health-care-ceo-shooting.html?unlocked_article_code=1.fk4.ZKwI.WZWBRweQDp97&amp;utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=trying-to-scold-the-entire-internet\" target=\"_blank\">tut-tutting</a> about all <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2024/12/05/opinion/unitedhealthcare-ceo-brian-thompson-being-murdered-shows-how-cruel-internet-trolls-are/?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=trying-to-scold-the-entire-internet\" target=\"_blank\">the memes</a> in every <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2024/12/05/reaction-unitedhealth-ceo-shooting-brian-thompson-insurance/?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=trying-to-scold-the-entire-internet\" target=\"_blank\">major newspaper</a>. I, personally, am not going super hard on the pro-assassination memes — as funny as they are — because we just don’t know what the motive was. We live in a time of mass accelerationist violence and I don’t feel like publicly cheerleading a guy who might have a compound full of deranged far-right ramblings. But I’m also not stupid enough to think that scolding the entire internet for how they’re acting is a meaningful use of my time on planet Earth. Maybe if I had a paid column somewhere — or proper health insurance — I’d feel different.</p><hr /><p><i>The following is a paid ad.

Newton took aim at what he described as the “AI is fake and sucks” school of thought, warning that it is downplays the possibility that the emergence of an AI superintelligence is both possible and dangerous.</p><p>Newton singled out New York University professor Gary Marcus, writing that his arguments are “extremely useful to those who believe that AI is fake and sucks, because they give it academic credentials and a sheen of empirical rigor.”</p><p>Marcus then <a href=\"https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/hard-forked-casey-newtons-distorted?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=trying-to-scold-the-entire-internet\" target=\"_blank\">responded</a> to Newton’s piece in his own newsletter, calling it a “distorted portrait of Gary Marcus” (he used the third person) and “AI skepticism.” </p><p>Now, I like and read both of these guys. I am also the child of divorce and perfectly comfortable playing both sides of a conflict. But I, also, do think that both of them are shades of correct here. Newton is right, there are millions of people using AI products right now and those AI products are lightyears better than they were two years ago and it’s not impossible that they will just keep getting better. And Marcus is also right, AI can continue to suck and also continue becoming increasingly dangerous. As an overwhelming amount of women can tell you, for instance, it’s already dangerous.</p><p>In fact, in a piece on Sunday, writer Edward Ongweso Jr summed this up quite nicely, <a href=\"https://thetechbubble.substack.com/p/the-phony-comforts-of-useful-idiots?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=trying-to-scold-the-entire-internet\" target=\"_blank\">writing</a> in his newsletter, “AI can be real and fake and suck and dangerous all at the same time or in different configurations.” Which is about as coherent a summary of my own feelings as I’m probably going to find.</p><p>But the real story here is that indie publishing is back, baby. </p><hr /><h2>The Bluesky Junk Invasion</h2><p>My favorite psuedononymous open source investigator and data scientist Conspirador Norteño is finally on Bluesky and <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/conspirator0.bsky.social?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=trying-to-scold-the-entire-internet\" target=\"_blank\">already using</a> the platform’s tools to surface some really cool stuff.</p><p>They’ve been monitoring Bluesky’s firehose — a live feed of every public post on the app — to identify botnets registering accounts en masse.

If you’re wondering why someone would put real money behind this it’s because, one, people are stupid, and, two, memecoins can make a lot of money and, well, see point one.</p><p>The smoking gun here, as to whether or not anything illegal happened, is the fact that almost 90% of the coins upon launch where owned by accounts that either were holding pre-launch or knew within seconds when to buy. Which has led to allegations of <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/hawk-tuah-memecoin-dumps-90-percent-outrage-token-launch-insider?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=trying-to-scold-the-entire-internet\" target=\"_blank\">insider trading</a>.
