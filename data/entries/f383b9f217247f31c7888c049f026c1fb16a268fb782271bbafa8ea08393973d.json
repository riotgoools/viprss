I guess both I and the world have been busy with other things and also keeping tabs on the entire interest and media landscape is just not something that’s possible.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, I am excited for this season to drop sometime in 2025. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_of_Us_season_2\">The skinny from Wikipedia</a> is:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>The second season, based on the 2020 game The Last of Us Part II, follows Joel (Pedro Pascal) and Ellie (Bella Ramsey) five years after the events of the first season, and introduces Abby (Kaitlyn Dever).</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>And that “the season is expected to span seven episodes”.</p>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/HBO\">HBO</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/The%20Last%20of%20Us\">The Last of Us</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/trailers\">trailers</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/TV\">TV</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/video\">video</a></p>\n\n         <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/10/the-last-of-us-season-two-trailer\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"f383b9f217247f31c7888c049f026c1fb16a268fb782271bbafa8ea08393973d","category":"Sites"}
