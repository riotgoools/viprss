Iâ€™ve only been on ice skates 6 or 7 times in my life and Iâ€™m getting better, but Iâ€™m still kinda wobbly, so donâ€™t take my word for it. Just watch him do all sorts of triple cows lutz axles better than anyoneâ€™s ever done it. My favorite part is when he does the two twisty jumps in a row, which he does at least 3 different times. Imagine being half this good at anything, let alone something as difficult as jumping in circles WITH RAZOR BLADES SCREWED TO YOUR DOC MARTENS.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>Malinin landed a quadruple Axel, quad Lutz, quad loop, quad Salchow, another quad Lutz and a quad toe loop, then finished his four-minute skate with a a triple Lutz-triple Axel finale.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>I donâ€™t live too far from Salem, and they still put people on trial for this kind of sorcery there.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/figure%20skating\">figure skating</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/ilia%20malinin\">ilia malinin</a></p>\n\n <p>ðŸ’¬ <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/03/ilia-malinin-is-good-as-hell-at-ice-skating\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> â†’</p>\n\n    ","author":"Aaron Cohen","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"b60625602c43bc211c6cef87abc708990ccb88545f41e6200d76e6e5d3435d54","category":"default"}
