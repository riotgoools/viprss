I'll try to remember not to do that in the future. </p>\n<p>I've noticed I spend less time programming, I go more slowly and carefully because now I can know a lot more about each problem I'm solving, and use the packages I build on, jQuery, MySQL, Node, the browser, Bootstrap, Font-awesome, Frontier, to greater advantage. A new kind of programming is possible, and it's better. </p>\n<p>I go into some detail in this podcast about how the process works. </p>\n<p>Interested in hearing similar stories from other developers using ChatGPT or something like it. </p>","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"43978485fdefe526ec9b501022e4f637085bb3d47337c3805a53d659d0e17e55","category":"default"}
