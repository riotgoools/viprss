Yet, the fear of increased insurance premiums deters many from undergoing tests. Genetic testing offers societal benefits but also presents significant distributional challenges. To address this, my 1994 paper proposed the idea of <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0167629694900051?via%3Dihub\">genetic insurance</a>.</p>\r\n<blockquote><p><span>For a small fee genetic insurance would insure against the possibility of a positive test result. If the test came back <span>positive the customer </span>would be paid a large sum of money, enough to cover the expected costs of his disease or equivalently enough to allow him to <span>purchase health </span>insurance at the new risk premium. If the test turns out negative the customer would lose his genetic insurance fee but would gain the results of the test and also lower health insurance premiums. Those who have <span>positive </span>tests results would be paid enough money to pay their health care costs and would also benefit from being able to plan in accord with the test results. Under this proposal average insurance rates will fall and everyone will be made better off.\\</span></p></blockquote>\r\n<p>Genetic insurance is insurance against changes in the cost of health insurance due to genetic information. John Cochrane would later generalize this idea to show that it’s possible to insure against changes in the cost of health insurance due to any new information. Cochrane called this <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.jstor.org/stable/2138695\">time-consistent health insurance</a> or <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/pa-633.pdf\">health-status insurance</a>; it’s a way of <span>creating long-term health insurance contracts without binding an individual to a firm.</span></p>\r\n<p>In an <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4717312\">interesting paper</a>, Helene Schernberg extends my 1994 paper. Schernberg shows that even if an individual has full-health insurance that can’t be taken away, there are other reasons to want genetic insurance. She focuses on the planning aspect. Genetic insurance could be used to shift consumption earlier, to better health states and thus improve life-time allocation.</p>\r\n<blockquote><p><span>Genetic testing could soon be a routine part of your medical journey. It offers insights into inherited disorders or susceptibility to various conditions. For example, if you are a woman with a BRCA mutation, you have a 55 to 72% lifetime risk of breast cancer.</span></p>\r\n<p>… <span>This suggests that genetic information is valuable while providing a theoretical argument in favor of genetic insurance. The mechanism is described in Tabarrok (1994): Individuals purchase genetic insurance before taking a genetic test, thus receiving a compensation upon being identified as a high-risk. Tabarrok (1994) relates this genetic insurance payment to the need to cover expensive health insurance premia. I show that it also relates to the fact</span> <span>that a temporally risk-averse individual wishes to insure against the lifetime utility losses she may experience when her health prospects deteriorate after taking a genetic test.</span></p></blockquote>\r\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/02/genetic-insurance.html\">Genetic Insurance</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com\">Marginal REVOLUTION</a>.</p>\r\n<img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/872284745/0/marginalrevolution\" />\r\n<div><a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/872284745/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/872284745/marginalrevolution,\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/872284745/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/x.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/872284745/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/872284745/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/02/genetic-insurance.html#comments\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/comments20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/02/genetic-insurance.html/feed\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/commentsrss20.png\" /></a> \r\n<div><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/02/genetic-insurance.html#comments\"><h3>Comments</h3></a><ul><li><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/02/genetic-insurance.html#comment-160723354\">So, right around the time this system is enacted, 50.07% of the ...</a> <i>by Neurotic</i></li><li><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/02/genetic-insurance.html#comment-160723348\">In reply to sisterogersintersectionalneighborhoodfilmreviews. ...</a> <i>by Fatty Arbuckle's Coke Bottle</i></li><li><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/02/genetic-insurance.html#comment-160723344\">In reply to Vivian Darkbloom.
