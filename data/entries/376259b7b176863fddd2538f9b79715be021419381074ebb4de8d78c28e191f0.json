Since we now understand that most of the information flow now goes around the NYT, CNN etc -- even Fox, and largely through social web and podcasts, if that's where we're all getting our news from, and btw MSNBC are already pretty well limited in what they'll tell us (this was our beef with NYT if you recall) -- the next step is to make it impossible for you to hear what I'm saying, they may still publish my blog, and you may think it sounds like me, but it won't be me. You should ask yourself now how you know this is me. And when you read something I say on Twitter how do you know I said that? You don't. My email comes through Google and Amazon. How do you know it came from me? In the past authoritarians had a harder time controlling the flow of news, now it'll be a snap. And remember they have Elon Musk and all his developers. He knows how to do all this, all he needed was the authority to do it, and in a few months he'll have it. We have a few months to anticipate this. Somehow we have to get some smarts into the White House before the transfer, to figure out how to plant seeds for a defense of our speech now. Later it'll be far too late. It's time to stop being so patient. Going out for a walk in the sunshine, back in a bit.","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"376259b7b176863fddd2538f9b79715be021419381074ebb4de8d78c28e191f0","category":"Sites"}
