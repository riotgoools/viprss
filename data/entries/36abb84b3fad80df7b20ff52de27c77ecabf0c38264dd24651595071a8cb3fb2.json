{"title":"How and why to make a /now page on your site","link":"https://sive.rs/now2","date":1715990400000,"content":"<h2>\nBackground\n</h2>\n<p>\nI used to wonder what my friend <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benny_Lewis\">Benny Lewis</a> was doing.\nHe has <a href=\"https://www.fluentin3months.com/\">a website</a> and social media accounts, but neither gave <strong>an overview of what he’s doing now</strong>.\n</p><p>\nThen I realized some people might wonder the same about me.\nSo in 2015, I made <a href=\"https://sive.rs/now\">a /now page</a> on my website, saying <strong>what I’d tell a friend I hadn’t seen in a year</strong>.\n</p><p>\nIt has a nice side-effect of being a public declaration of priorities.\nIt’s a good link to give people when <a href=\"https://sive.rs/n\">saying no</a> to invitations and distractions.\n</p><p>\nWord spread, and soon <strong><a href=\"https://nownownow.com/\">hundreds of people</a> had a /now page on their personal website</strong>.\nSo I made a site to showcase them all: <strong><a href=\"https://nownownow.com/\">nownownow.com</a></strong> — (a static site generated by <a href=\"https://sive.rs/pg2\">PostgreSQL functions</a>.)\nIt currently has over <a href=\"https://nownownow.com/\">2300 people</a> worldwide.\nThis week I added browse by location and search.\n</p>\n<h2>\nGot a personal website? Add a /now page\n</h2>\n<p>\nThe three main ingredients are:\n</p>\n<ol><li>\na page, usually at URL /now, linked from your main menu, usually alongside /about\n</li><li>\nan overview of what’s going on with you — what you’d tell a friend you hadn’t seen in a year\n</li><li>\nthe date it was last updated\n</li></ol>\n<h2>\nWordPress instructions:\n</h2>\n<p>\nIn the left menu, under “<strong>Pages</strong>”, click “<strong>Add New Page</strong>”.\nThen, where it says “Add title”, replace that with just three letters: <strong>now</strong>.\nThat will ensure the URL is /now, and after it’s posted, you can change the title to “What I’m doing now” or whatever.\n</p>\n<img src=\"/images/now-wordpress-1.png\" alt=\"screenshot to make /now page on wordpress\" />\n<br />\n<img src=\"/images/now-wordpress-2.png\" alt=\"screenshot to make /now page on wordpress\" />\n<h2>\nWix instructions:\n</h2>\n<p>\nOn the left, under “<strong>Site Menu</strong>”, click “<strong>+ Add Page</strong>”.\nCall it <strong>Now</strong>, next to your “About” page.\nClick the (…) to its right, then to “<strong>SEO basics</strong>”, to edit “<strong>URL slug</strong>” and make sure it’s just the three letters: now\n</p>\n<img src=\"/images/now-wix-1.png\" alt=\"screenshot to make /now page on wix\" />\n<br />\n<img src=\"/images/now-wix-2.png\" alt=\"screenshot to make /now page on wix\" />\n<br />\n<img src=\"/images/now-wix-3.png\" alt=\"screenshot to make /now page on wix\" />\n<p></p>\n<h2>\nNo website yet? Use <a href=\"https://bearblog.dev/\">Bear</a>\n</h2>\n<p>\nIf you don’t have a personal website yet, I highly recommend <a href=\"https://bearblog.dev/\">Bear</a> at <a href=\"https://bearblog.dev/\">BearBlog.dev</a>.\nIt’s so simple, clean, and free.\nThe owner and creator, <a href=\"https://herman.bearblog.dev/\">Herman in South Africa</a>, runs it himself with great love.\nAnd no investors so no <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification\">enshittification</a>.\nHe plans to keep it alive <a href=\"https://herman.bearblog.dev/building-software-to-last-forever/\">forever</a>.\n</p><p>\nI believe in it so much that I told Herman I would be its godfather.\nIf he ever can’t (or doesn’t want to) run it anymore, I will help run it, or fund a foundation to keep it alive.\n</p><p>\nTo create a /now page on Bear, click “<strong>Pages</strong>”, then “<strong>New page</strong>”.\nThen, after it says “<strong>title:</strong>”, type just three letters: <strong>now</strong>.\nThat will ensure the URL is /now, and after it’s posted, you can change the title to “What I’m doing now” or whatever.\n</p>\n<img src=\"/images/now-bear-1.png\" alt=\"screenshot to make /now page on bearblog.dev\" />\n<br />\n<img src=\"/images/now-bear-2.png\" alt=\"screenshot to make /now page on bearblog.dev\" />\n<h2>\nGot a /now page? I’ll add you to <a href=\"https://nownownow.com/\">nownownow.com</a>\n</h2>\n<p>\nOnce it’s live, just <a href=\"https://sive.rs/contact\">email me your URL</a>, and I add it (by hand) to <a href=\"https://nownownow.com/\">nownownow.com</a>.\n(This is also a good time to say hello, if you haven’t yet. I read and reply to every email.)\n</p>\n<a href=\"http://nownownow.com/\"><img src=\"/images/nowclock.jpg\" /></a>","author":"Derek Sivers","siteTitle":"Derek Sivers","siteHash":"4098504c0d0759e13901f29e63f7d7dbb1d972a078c6dc4560660f373da5c25e","entryHash":"36abb84b3fad80df7b20ff52de27c77ecabf0c38264dd24651595071a8cb3fb2","category":"Sites"}
