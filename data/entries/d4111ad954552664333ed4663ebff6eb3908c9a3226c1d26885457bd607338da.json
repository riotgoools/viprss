Almost all playoff series that aren't sweeps are intense, but this one was especially so. So we're on to the <a href=\"https://fox59.com/sports/pacers/schedule-released-for-pacers-knicks-playoff-series/\">next round</a>, starting Monday, back in NYC, against the Indiana Pacers, an excellent team this year. And Doc Searls, who is also a Knicks fan, now lives in Indiana, so he is somewhat justified in believing the world revolves around him. I've always had that sense about Doc.","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"d4111ad954552664333ed4663ebff6eb3908c9a3226c1d26885457bd607338da","category":"default"}
