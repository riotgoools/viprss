{"title":"The Problem with Podcasts","link":"https://om.co/2024/10/22/the-problem-with-podcasts/","date":1729607585000,"content":"<figure><img width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://149366103.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/podcast-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Photo by Jason Rosewell via Unsplash\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Why does every podcast have a six-minute lead of proverbial throat-clearing, self-promotion, and advertising? I can understand that mega podcasts like Joe Rogan’s have to deal with this — advertisers are throwing money at people like him and Tim Ferriss. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem is more acute with relatively smaller podcasts. I listen to many “intellectually curious” podcasts that focus on subjects such as science, history, design, and architecture. They seem to be the worst offenders, though not as bad as some sports-focused shows. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Will the podcasts give me an ad-free experience with subscriptions? The answer is no. I thought the whole point of podcasts was to free us from the past, aka the “radio,” and its format tyranny. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s not just podcasts—streaming nowadays is no better than television. Netflix, the company that invented binge-watching, now releases episodes once a week, like old-school TV. Independent blogs and newsletters are less personal and more like old media.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The more things change, the more they stay the same! </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>October 22, 2024.
