I have to do it because there are huge holes in the web as a development platform. And every year it gets worse as new incompatible languages are added, new stacks incompatible stacks built. As a result we have to re-do everything all the time, and never get a chance to create any new user experiences. The market fragments, which is exactly what the tech companies want. It keeps their products from becoming commodities. And like it or not, the politicians and corporations don't want us writing too much, they just want us working, donating to their campaigns, paying taxes, buying their crap, and not getting all agitated about the things they don't care about.","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"a2f4c3f9fabf69610ad2af698193e250b9727373138324acb9952ec41930cc05","category":"default"}
