One of my fellow jurors worked at NASAâ€™s Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL) and extended an open invitation to bring the kids for a special tour, not just the regular one that anyone can do. On June 15, 2023 I could finally take him up on the invitation. While we were there, we got to see the Europa Clipper spacecraft being built. I remember getting chills and even getting a little choked up. Today the spacecraft is being launched on a Space X mission to begin its 1.8 billion-mile (2.9 billion-km) journey to reach Jupiter sometime in April 2030. It will orbit Jupiter, and conduct 49 close flybys of Europa.</p>\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/4832/2024/bee8f5e84e.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" />","author":"","siteTitle":"micro.brad","siteHash":"27daae1c149c6ec5a964b1fe9266f5a58f96cfb4b36e39006f255c6b2b53a76d","entryHash":"4313030176324ee2f96c4759f8160f70049c7a8ecfb266b1288ca63cf9dcf7dc","category":"Sites"}
