[Mild spoilers may follow.] Shortly after, we meet war journalist Lee (Kirsten Dunst in a standout performance). I thought, “She looks like Lee Miller,” and seconds later, the name is dropped. In the next shot, Lee is <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.newyorker.com/culture/photo-booth/when-lee-miller-took-a-bath-in-hitlers-tub\">in a bathtub</a>—a clear sign you’re in the hands of a master. It is not without import that Lee Miller <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://samwallacemedia.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/miller-cc.png\">photographed Dachau</a> or a little less obviously that she was a <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://aperture.org/editorial/how-lee-miller-out-surrealed-the-surrealists/\">pioneer of the surreal</a>. Both will reappear in Civil War.</p>\r\n<p>In a scene where the journalists need to buy gas, they offer $300. The armed attendant scoffs, “$300 will get you a ham sandwich.” “$300 Canadian,” comes the reply, telling you everything you need to know about the state of the economy.</p>\r\n<p><em>Civil War</em> was written and directed by Alex Garland, who also made <em>Annihilation</em>, <em>Ex Machina</em>, and the underrated <em>Dredd</em> (the 2012 reboot not the Stallone movie). Many viewers expected Civil War to serve some lectures about red state/blue state politics, but it doesn’t. Tyler makes <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/04/the-politics-of-civil-war-full-of-spoilers-do-not-read.html\">astute comments</a> about the hidden politics (and reviews the movie <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/04/civil-war.html\">here</a>).</p>\r\n<p>M<span>y interest was more on how the film portrays war—war is hell but it’s also fucking amazing. The photojournalists at the heart of the story justify their actions as serving a higher purpose, but in reality, they have become addicted to the adrenaline. </span><em>Civil War</em> shares themes with <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nightcrawler_(film)\"><em>Nightcrawler</em></a>. The journalists also share more than they think with the sick fucks who also love war because it gives them a chance to torture and kill.</p>\r\n<p>A great scene at the climax incarnates the “when one dies, another is born” trope. The lead character starts to <em>feel</em> and gain a moral code, only to be killed for it, while the apprentice simultaneously sheds hers, emerging as a new, amoral hero. And it’s all caught on film. Karma is a bitch. The transition isn’t surprising given the logic of the setup but it is handled with originality and grace.</p>\r\n<p>Recommended, given the obvious strictures about violence and serious themes.</p>\r\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/09/civil-war-2.html\">Civil War</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com\">Marginal REVOLUTION</a>.</p>\r\n<img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/904587962/0/marginalrevolution\" />\r\n<div><a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/904587962/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/904587962/marginalrevolution,https%3a%2f%2fmarginalrevolution.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2024%2f09%2fDunst.png\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/904587962/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/x.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/904587962/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/904587962/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/09/civil-war-2.html#comments\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/comments20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/09/civil-war-2.html/feed\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/commentsrss20.png\" /></a> \r\n<div><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/09/civil-war-2.html#comments\"><h3>Comments</h3></a><ul><li><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/09/civil-war-2.html#comment-160811898\">I never knew that I'd seen so many photos of / by the same ...</a> <i>by BenS</i></li><li><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/09/civil-war-2.html#comment-160811897\">I think you're right.
