Marisa Kabas wrote <a href=\"https://www.thehandbasket.co/p/trump-windmills-project-2025\">a great one-sentence summary of the project</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>Project 2025 is conservatives’ vision for an American society that’s a result of gutting all the gains made by the civil rights, abortion rights, LGBTIA+ rights, voting rights and environmental rights movements in order to establish an authoritarian government run by loyalists committed to serving a white, Christian nationalist agenda.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>What I like about that description is that the authors of the plan wouldn’t really disagree with it. The plan’s uncomplicated &amp; proud sincerity in wanting to roll back all the rights fought for in this country since the 1950s is what makes it so alarming.</p>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Marisa%20Kabas\">Marisa Kabas</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/politics\">politics</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Project%202025\">Project 2025</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/USA\">USA</a></p>\n\n        \n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"8ccbfd5ed6d22b88bd65c4cba053de52f8e05c60dcc653644221c5980f9137fe","category":"default"}
