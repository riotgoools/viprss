It's very easy to do. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>In <a href=\"https://feedland.com/\">FeedLand</a>, choose <i>My feed list</i> in the first menu.</li>\n<li>Click on the white-on-orange XML icon, in the upper right corner of the page.</li>\n<li>That will open a standard OPML version of your subscription list. This is the format that all feed reading software understands. </li>\n<li>In your browser, choose the <i>Save Page As</i> command in the File menu (or something like that, there are lots of browsers) and save it along with your other backups.</li>\n<li>You can also automate it if you can run a script that gets stuff over the internet. Once a night would be fine, not a huge burden on the server. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>I added another way to preserve your feed list, using localStorage.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Every time you sign in FeedLand now saves a copy of your subscription list in localStorage. </li>\n<li>And if the FeedLand server you're using should happen to disappear, if you have not taken a backup in a while, if you have a tab open, you'll at least have a copy in localStorage. </li>\n<li>If you want to see it -- visit feedland.org or feedland.com, wherever you have an account, and do a hard reload. Then open the JavaScript console, and enter this line:</li>\n<ul>\n<li><code>console.log (localStorage.savedUserSubs)</code></li>\n</ul>\n<li>If you have questions, here's a <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/feedlandSupport/issues/240\">thread</a>.</li>\n</ul>","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"e3d8a7c2e3a1f4c6e9e45fff617b9c083b4e1634eee16a95542e4d164f10f440","category":"default"}
