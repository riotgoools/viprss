{"title":"Seven Samurai&#8217;s 4K Restoration","link":"https://kottke.org/24/06/seven-samurais-4k-restoration","date":1718377862000,"content":"\n        <p></p>\n\n<p>A 4K restoration of Akira Kurosawa’s epic Seven Samurai is heading to theaters this summer. The film screened at Cannes in May and <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2024/06/seven-samurai-janus-films-4k-restoration-nyc-la-july-first-look-trailer-poster-1235960502/\">screenings in the US start in July</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>Janus will open the restoration on Friday, July 5 in New York at Film Forum after which a Los Angeles premiere will take place at the American Cinematheque’s Egyptian Theatre on Sunday, July 7. The film will open wide on Friday, July 12 in Los Angeles at Laemmle Royal.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Here’s the official poster for the restoration:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/seven-sam-4k.jpg\" srcset=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=500,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/seven-sam-4k.jpg 500w, /cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/seven-sam-4k.jpg 1200w\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1300\" height=\"1926\" alt=\"poster for the 4K restoration of Seven Samurai\" /></p>\n\n<p>On a personal note, I’m pretty disheartened there’s a 99% chance this won’t be playing anywhere near me in Vermont. Run Lola Run was <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/04/0044496-yesss-run-lola-run-is\">rereleased in theaters last week</a> and I couldn’t find it anywhere within a reasonable drive. And the nearest IMAX is 2h15m away. I’m thankful that I can get all sorts of culture pumped into my house at gigabit speeds, but per contemporary wisdom, “we’ve got Seven Samurai’s 4K restoration at home” is just not the same.</p>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Akira%20Kurosawa\">Akira Kurosawa</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/movies\">movies</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Seven%20Samurai\">Seven Samurai</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/trailers\">trailers</a></p>\n\n         <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/06/seven-samurais-4k-restoration\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"fb247b45a0cf45482c95b871a44f0144b2de0f81b651c067b24885d6cef3d56a","category":"default"}
