Here’s a British Pathé film from 1961 that shows how tennis balls were made, along with Wimbledon ball boy training:</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>I also didn’t know that <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/02/what-color-tennis-ball-green-yellow/523521/?gift=j9r7avb6p-KY8zdjhsiSZx9acGaDK9J4dJLiWAAjguA\">many people think tennis balls are green</a> when they are actually a color called “optic yellow”. Oh and that <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/C8FF2vhCgob/\">David Attenborough had a hand</a> in <a href=\"https://www.marca.com/en/tennis/roland-garros-/2024/05/22/664dc4c222601d0a4e8b45c8.html\">the switch from white to yellow</a>.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>The change in color happened due to the demands of television transmissions. In 1972 television was already in color all over the world (although in Spain it was not generalized until five or six years later). At the end of the 1960s, the person in charge of the BBC broadcasts (which, of course, was in charge of Wimbledon) was the renowned documentary filmmaker David Attenborough. And he noticed that the visibility of the traditional white ball was not perfect, especially if it approached the lines of the rectangle of play.</p>\n\n<p>In that year of 1972, tennis was in full growth: the professional and amateur circuits had unified and women’s professional tennis was also growing. Tennis was becoming a great world spectacle and in this context television was fundamental. The International Tennis Federation, in charge of the rules, commissioned a study which showed that the yellow ball was more visible and therefore easier for viewers to follow. The courts, moreover, began to be multicolored once the use of synthetic materials in official tournaments was approved.</p></blockquote>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/color\">color</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/David%20Attenborough\">David Attenborough</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/how%20to\">how to</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/sports\">sports</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/tennis\">tennis</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/TV\">TV</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/video\">video</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Wimbledon\">Wimbledon</a></p>\n\n         <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/06/how-tennis-balls-became-yellow-feat-david-attenborough\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"dadb106a5e7e0af7ba03f7ffc0f0e950a89d0cb2522b182b9a7a86266c52fe31","category":"default"}
