Pandora's Box has been opened, nay, wretched and\nheld open by the data brokerage economy; empowered by unscrupulous advertisers,\ntheir lobbyists, and their political allies eager to make a quick buck at the\nexpense (lol, get wrecked) of us all.</p>\n<p>No, that Internet is gone…pilfered and gutted for its good parts, redesigned and\nrepackaged with dark patterns to keep us hooked on services we don't really\nlike; digital cocaine, if you will.</p>\n<p>What we <em>can</em> do is build a new Internet, together. We don't need permission.\nWe can just…do it, in our own way.</p>\n<p><em>screams internally</em>\nUGH. Why do <em>I</em> have to work for this? I HAD it and it got stolen!!</p>\n<p>I feel you. Truly. But if you can see the joy in tragedy, maybe you can be\ninspired to code, sketch, write, or otherwise contribute to a\nrebirth (renaissance?!) of the internet.</p>\n<p>However, a common mistake we collectively make about taking the internet back\ninto our own hands is assuming everyone has the time and energy to code a blog\nor set up a server. Even opening a terminal is too much for most. You might be\nthinking, \"you're hinting at creating platforms…isn't that how we got into this\nmess in the first place?\"</p>\n<p>Platforms aren't inherently evil, they're just the vehicles through which our\nInternet was poisoned. How can we ensure that won't happen again? To quote my\nfriend, Jordan Green:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Internet amplified voices you could've easily ignored in the past.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That is, aside from giving transgressors a judgmental eye, ignore them.\nDon't engage. Don't sign up for their service. Recommend comparable services to\nfriends and family who may inquire. We know damn well that Facebook and Google\nill catch on and try to ride the wave (see: Facebook threatening the Fediverse\nwith Threads integration, and Google shutting down yet <em>another</em> service after\ngobbling up user data because \"refocusing efforts\").</p>\n<p>\"Web3,\" a marketing term for Ethereum-based platforms and services, is supposed\nto save us…right? Or maybe it's \"the dWeb,\" the lesser-known marketing term for\nblockchain-/community-based platforms and services. Their evangelists are\ncertainly loud as fuck about how their favorite blockchain is THE key to\nunlocking a brighter future on the 'Net (greetings, I just roasted myself and am\nan avid evangelist of (for?) the Handshake blockchain and will talk your ear off\nif you let me).</p>\n<p>I think the <em>solutions</em> are somewhere in the middle. Notice the plural? There is\nno singular salve for the blights upon our digital land, despite what anyone\nsays (I especially despise absolutist rhetoric, go touch grass, breathe\nfresh air, or take a nap).</p>\n<p>So, where do you come in?</p>\n<p>If you're technical, write guides for normies (and for future you, who will\nforget details).</p>\n<p>If you're entrepreneurial, build platforms that make it super easy for anyone to\njump into the next stage of the internet. You have a major responsibility to not\nget swayed by a billion-dollar check from these tech companies (idk your\nfinancial situation so do you, I guess).</p>\n<p>If you're artistic, draw, paint, and sculpt the idealized future you\nwant to see.</p>\n<p>If you're a musician, become more experimental with your tunes and collaborate\nwith visual artists for your cover art.</p>\n<p>If you're a creator, period, you have no idea just how powerful you are;\neveryone is inspired by art and depictions of what <em>could</em> be. Think of your art\nas a template for a new world.</p>\n<p>Create in whichever way you know how. We aren't getting our Internet back but we\nsure as hell can steward a new one.</p>\n<p>🕸️</p>\n","author":"","siteTitle":"the webb blog","siteHash":"d87386c8de21b16d23a4d22ceb0991728c5b4e4486d627490c6fcde14e563300","entryHash":"172049707ee244433afd32a0a37e3b0d1b13bac38fe7fc8e8f205d5130109755","category":"Sites"}
