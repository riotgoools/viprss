That made it “3,300 times as powerful” as the bomb dropped on Hiroshima — an almost unimaginable level of potential destructive power. But Tsar Bomba wasn’t even close to being the biggest nuclear weapon ever conceived. <a href=\"https://thebulletin.org/2021/11/the-untold-story-of-the-worlds-biggest-nuclear-bomb/\">Meet Project Sundial</a>, courtesy of Edward Teller, one of the inventors of the hydrogen bomb, and his colleagues at Los Alamos:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>Only a few months later, in July 1954, Teller made it clear he thought 15 megatons was child’s play. At a secret meeting of the General Advisory Committee of the Atomic Energy Commission, Teller broached, as he put it, “the possibility of much bigger bangs.” At his Livermore laboratory, he reported, they were working on two new weapon designs, dubbed Gnomon and Sundial. Gnomon would be 1,000 megatons and would be used like a “primary” to set off Sundial, which would be 10,000 megatons.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>10,000 megatons. In the video above, Kurzgesagt speculates that exploding a bomb of that size would result in a fireball “up to 50 kilometers in diameter, larger than the visible horizon”, a magnitude 9 earthquake, a noise that can be heard around the entire Earth, a 400 km in which everything is “instantly set on fire – every tree, house, person”, and, eventually, the deaths of most of the Earth’s population.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>Sundial would bring about an apocalyptic nuclear winter, where global temperatures suddenly drop by 10°C, most water sources would be contaminated and crops would fail everywhere. Most people in the world would die.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Fun fact: Edward Teller was one of Stanley Kubrick’s inspirations for the bomb-giddy character of Dr. Strangelove in the 1964 film of the same name.</p>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/atomic%20bomb\">atomic bomb</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Edward%20Teller\">Edward Teller</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Kurzgesagt\">Kurzgesagt</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/science\">science</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/video\">video</a></p>\n\n         <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/12/the-biggest-bomb-in-the-world\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"03f97e861ae6d9b33c49600cb1993c73d2f6b4f99b265e1ce886d3a17d231e92","category":"Sites"}
