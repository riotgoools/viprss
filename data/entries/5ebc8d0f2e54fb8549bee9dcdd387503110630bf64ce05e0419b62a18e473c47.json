MacAskill and four friends take to the local mountain bike trails around Inverness, Scotland on ebikes and have a grand old time. For me, listening to the banter was just as entertaining as watching the riding — it’s obvious they’re just out there having a blast.</p>\n\n<p>P.S. I was also trying to calculate how fast I would die if I tried riding some of that stuff and the answer is “almost immediately”. Yiiiikes.</p>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/biking\">biking</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/cycling\">cycling</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Danny%20MacAskill\">Danny MacAskill</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Scotland\">Scotland</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/sports\">sports</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/video\">video</a></p>\n\n         <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/05/danny-macaskill-goes-mountain-biking-with-friends-in-scotland\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"5ebc8d0f2e54fb8549bee9dcdd387503110630bf64ce05e0419b62a18e473c47","category":"default"}
