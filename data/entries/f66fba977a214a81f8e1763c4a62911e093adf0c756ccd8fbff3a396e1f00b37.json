I imagine for someone who knows both WordPress and Bluesky this might be a weekend project? </li>\n<li>Do it, and blow our minds! There's a lot of content out there in WordPress and a lot of people publish on it.  </li>\n<li>And the best part of it is that it totally drives adoption of <a href=\"https://textcasting.org/\">textcasting</a> which is my not so hidden agenda. <span>ðŸ˜„</span></li>\n<li>And for the people who are starting to think it's only an ActivityPub thing, think again. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you do this you might not win the Nobel Peace Prize but you will be Nerd of the Year in my book! </p>","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"f66fba977a214a81f8e1763c4a62911e093adf0c756ccd8fbff3a396e1f00b37","category":"Sites"}
