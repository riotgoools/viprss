Itâ€™s madness is what it is. </p>\n\n<p>The lack of iced tea soda is only an aside to the main news of this post, offered as preamble, because <a href=\"https://www.chewboom.com/2024/03/27/7-eleven-unveils-new-big-bite-hot-dog-sparkling-water/\">you canâ€™t really just jump into something like hot dog seltzer water without some sort of sweetener,</a> some sort of softening the ground ahead of the news, an amuse bouche if you will. </p>\n\n<p>Iâ€™m pretty angry about this because itâ€™s probably an April Fools joke announced early and corporations fucking lie all the time, but the least they could do is not pre-announce an April Fools joke. Now that April Fools has been coopted by try-hard brands, uh, trying too hard, a really good and cool thing for a brand to do would be to announce something what seems like a joke on April Fools and then actually deliver. No more phony bologna. If the Big Bite Hot Dog Sparkling Water is not a figment of commercial japery, if it is not a form of incorporated jackassery, if it actually exists on April 2nd, Iâ€™ll <s>eat my hat</s> drink one.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/hotdogseltzer.jpg\" srcset=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=500,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/hotdogseltzer.jpg 500w, /cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/hotdogseltzer.jpg 1200w\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"678\" height=\"381\" alt=\"hotdogseltzer.jpg\" /> </p>\n\n<blockquote><p>The Big Bite Hot Dog Sparkling Water promises to encapsulate the essence of the iconic 7-Eleven hot dog experience, complete with the flavors of ketchup and mustard.
