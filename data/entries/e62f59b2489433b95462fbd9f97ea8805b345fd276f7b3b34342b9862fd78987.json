No one is leaving and no one is being left in this unison of movement along a vector of common purpose. It is the only instance I know of a transition that is not a rupture but an affirmation of a bond — an immense family of beings magnetized together by unassailable belonging, governed by the elemental life-force pulsating beneath every longing for connection and communion. </p>\n<p>And yet no spell against abandonment can ever protect us from the most terrifying and most certain of losses. This, in fact, is why the relationship rupture is <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2022/09/06/general-theory-of-love-separation/\">so psychologically painful</a> — every abandonment is a miniature of death. </p>\n<p>Japanese artist and storyteller <strong>Keizaburō Tejima</strong> brings uncommon tenderness to this bittersweet inevitability of life in his 1988 book <a

McClure</a>, Tejima’s woodcuts rise from the page stark and sensitive as a child’s experience of change. </p>\n<p>The story begins in a faraway lake, where the swans winter “until the wind is laced with the first warmth of spring.” Year after year, when that moment comes, they lift off as one immense V to soar together toward their summer home in the north, filling the sky with their ancient cries.</p>\n<p> <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0399215476/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\"
