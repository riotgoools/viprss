{"title":"The White Death","link":"https://kottke.org/24/06/the-white-death","date":1719436229000,"content":"\n        <p></p>\n\n<p>John Green recently teamed up with Kurzgesagt for a video on one of the worldâ€™s deadliest diseases: tuberculosis.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>The white death has haunted humanity like no other disease following us for thousands, maybe millions of years. In the last 200 years <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/502S2a\">it killed a billion people</a> â€” way more than all wars and natural disasters combined. Even today itâ€™s the infectious disease with the highest kill count.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>The maddening bit is that tuberculosis is curableâ€¦itâ€™s just that the cure is not equally distributed around the world.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>4,000 people died of tuberculosis yesterday, and we simply donâ€™t have to accept a world where so many of us still die of a disease we know how to cure. The White Death has been with us for millions of years. It is time to continue our journey without it.</p></blockquote>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/death\">death</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/disease\">disease</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/John%20Green\">John Green</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Kurzgesagt\">Kurzgesagt</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/medicine\">medicine</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/science\">science</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/video\">video</a></p>\n\n         <p>ðŸ’¬ <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/06/the-white-death\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> â†’</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"7a7ab9599d10944b20269a3387a7b4351888691dd4bef177b001a96e02e4e16b","category":"default"}
