Josh Neuman skateboarding down a mountain road while cars come up makes me real nervous! He almost skates into a barrier at 2:07, and towards the end thereâ€™s a biker riding up the hill going very slow showing how steep this is. I donâ€™t know. Itâ€™s too fast I think. Love to see someone as good at their job as this guy.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Josh%20Neuman\">Josh Neuman</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/skateboarding\">skateboarding</a></p>\n\n         <p>ðŸ’¬ <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/11/downhill-skateboarding\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> â†’</p>\n\n    ","author":"Aaron Cohen","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"0f852f223e8b2f4900e6df298c023cc0b63009f4666bc8301fff6e69e4768cc9","category":"Sites"}
