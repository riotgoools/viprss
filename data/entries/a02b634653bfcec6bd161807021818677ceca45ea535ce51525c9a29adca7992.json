The original version topped out at 8. </p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>Hereâ€™s the original.<br />\n</p>\n\n<p><br />\nHereâ€™s a country version.<br />\n</p>\n\n<p><br />\nHereâ€™s a punk cover validating my theory stating pop songs usually sound good as punk songs.<br />\n</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, I was thinking about this because a few years ago <a href=\"https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/dancing-on-my-own/pl.u-BNA6rgNu2dbZ0\">I made a playlist for the kids of all the covers of Dancing on My Own</a> I could find and there were 56 back then. Today I added all the ones which were added to Apple Music in the last few years and now there are 91 total on the list, though 2 or 3 are remixes. </p>\n\n<p><br />\n</p>\n\n <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Callum%20Scott\">Callum Scott</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Kings%20of%20Leon\">Kings of Leon</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Robyn\">Robyn</a></p>\n\n <p>ðŸ’¬ <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/03/dancing-on-my-own\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> â†’</p>\n\n    ","author":"Aaron Cohen","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"a02b634653bfcec6bd161807021818677ceca45ea535ce51525c9a29adca7992","category":"default"}
