Stop <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=vilifying\">vilifying</a> men. <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2021/11/05/don-lemon-james-carville-democrats-stupid-wokeness-newday-vpx.cnn\">Carville was right</a>. There's no reason to make one whole gender the scapegoat for all our problems. It's no accident that the Repubs own the men. We could probably have had ten percent or more of their voters if we stopped doing this. A lot of people just can't see that they do it. And they don't like to have it pointed out. But we're living with the result on November 6, 2024. Remember that men are people, and have feelings, and don't like being blamed for things they have no power over, just like everyone else. If you're going to say something about men that you wouldn't say about women, or black people or Jews, then hold the thought and ask yourself why. It's an example of \"be the change you wish to see in the world.\" This is one thing we have the power to change, so let's do it.","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"c37c5875d3ebbf626bb4c608a4978fe6e6d5dbc35441b9832609ab563260f630","category":"Sites"}
