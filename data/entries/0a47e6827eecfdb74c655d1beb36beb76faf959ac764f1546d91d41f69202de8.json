{"title":"[RIDGELINE] Movie Credit Boredom in Japan","link":"https://craigmod.com/ridgeline/168/","date":1691798400000,"content":"Ridgeliners —\nWhen I started Ridgeline some many many years ago (4.5-ish), the plan was to cap each post at about 300 words. I was cribbing from Sam Anderson’s “New Sentences” column that had a similar rule. Obviously, I didn’t stick to that rule. But the reason for that cap was to make weekly-consistency non-negotiable. As in, you can always bang out 300 words, you fool. So in honor of all that, a shorter one.","author":"","siteTitle":"Craig Mod","siteHash":"7358923c3192bccfb6b9f0032f475bef5140f12de0f235c80ca3d98e1a3d393b","entryHash":"0a47e6827eecfdb74c655d1beb36beb76faf959ac764f1546d91d41f69202de8","category":"Sites"}
