Of course she's still even better than she appears. I really mean that, and if you read this blog regularly you know. But what would a random person think? Hmm. Maybe that it's strange, this is a picture of the would-be president, and it's a good one. I wonder if there are many levels of irony going on at this moment, the visitor might think. No matter how much I love the Democratic team this year, this is not a campaign site. I don't take ads. This is just a blog. You might have to peer below the surface to figure out what's going on. Even the guy who writes this freaking thing can't see all the angles. For now neither the image or motto are changing. There hasn't always been a motto there you know.","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"341ee4e1f8df71e5a1e61e9fbe7ac07a0d739340a3b5cb9153cd1eca52a81d5f","category":"Sites"}
