Laura sold her car to Carvana before we left for Colorado. I had a haircut scheduled at the same time she had to drive to a lunch, so she dropped me off. It was close enough that I could walk home, but far enough to justify hopping on an electric scooter. I hadn’t been on one for years and didn’t have the app anymore, but within a couple of minutes I was on my way home. Navigation while riding is still a problem, which is a bit crazy. There’s no place to put my phone and looking at my watch takes a hand off the scooter, which isn’t ideal. Electric scooters are much too slow to be sharing roads with cars, especially in Los Angeles. I had to be on a major thoroughfare for a few blocks and it was a bit harrowing. While I can’t imagine riding a scooter that does 60+ (<a href=\"https://www.electricscooterinsider.com/fastest-electric-scooters/\">they do exist</a> apparently!), a top speed of 40 feels like a good top speed. I say all of this knowing nothing about electric scooters.</p>","author":"bradbarrish","siteTitle":"Brad Barrish","siteHash":"91e49f51884b2947fac16e947ba7e59fe5a24800befb4760d388da1b057f4f23","entryHash":"c22ef74166fe74206214de33e2a19e92281d1069ae2e375875782e884a7ab891","category":"default"}
