This is an <em>amazing</em> resource.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>British Pathé was once a dominant feature of the British cinema experience, renowned for first-class reporting and an informative yet uniquely entertaining style. It is now considered to be the finest newsreel archive in existence. Spanning the years from 1896 to 1976, the collection includes footage — not only from Britain, but from around the globe — of major events, famous faces, fashion trends, travel, sport and culture. The archive is particularly strong in its coverage of the First and Second World Wars.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>I’ve shared videos from British Pathé before: <a href=\"http://kottke.org/12/02/film-footage-of-the-hindenburg-disaster\">the Hindenberg disaster</a> and <a href=\"http://kottke.org/12/03/the-worlds-heaviest-baby\">this bizarre film of a little boy being taunted with chocolate</a>. The archive is chock full of gems: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7Iaz_r2t-g\">a 19-year-old Arnold Schwarzenegger at a bodybuilding competition</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xKDRmhp6lQ\">footage of and interviews with survivors of the Titanic</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5McWw03Ryrs\">video of the world’s tallest man (8’11”)</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XggxeuFDaDU\">the collapse of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge</a>. And this film from 1956 showing how cricket balls are made by hand:</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n         <p><em>[This is a vintage post originally from Apr 2014.]</em></p>\n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/British%20Pathe\">British Pathe</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/timeless%20posts\">timeless posts</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/video\">video</a></p>\n\n        \n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"ed41858fde8421dad24d8f020a1469fc111f0bdfe07b24f2e7bc519a6cd26bce","category":"Sites"}
