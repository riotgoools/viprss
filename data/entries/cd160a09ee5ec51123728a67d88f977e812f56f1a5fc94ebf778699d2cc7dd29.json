{"title":"What MAGA really means","link":"http://scripting.com/2024/02/19/140617.html?title=whatMagaReallyMeans","date":1708351577000,"content":"<p><img src=\"https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/04/10/trumpBeingCarriedAway.png\" />I've mostly kept Trump off the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/\">home page</a> of this blog since he left office in 2021, but things are changing, and this is shaping up as a Trump year. I read today in the NYT that the resistance <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/19/us/politics/trump-resistance-democrats-voters.html?unlocked_article_code=1.Wk0.0hoY.duTfLtk_PUxj&amp;smid=url-share\">is exhausted</a>. Bullshit. We're very well rested. The NYT is a den of assholes. They should explain themselves, or it's time to set up a receptacle for leaks from within so we can get the truth about who's selling us out to Trump and Putin inside the NYT so we know who to blame. Anyway I look forward to once again, pretending Trump doesn't exist, next year or the year after, Murphy-willing. </p>\n<p>The other day when I was skiing at <a href=\"https://www.belleayre.com/\">Belleayre</a>, I got to ride up on a chairlift with a Trump supporter. He told me he got Covid but it wasn't a big deal, just like a cold. I said a lot of people died from Covid. He said most were already sick or overweight. I said yeah but they deserve to live too. He said he didn't get vaccinated, he doesn't like to put drugs in his body. What bullshit I muttered under my breath. I looked at him, maybe ten years younger than me. From New Jersey, a house painter. I said that my life has been saved by drugs at least twice, once when I was perfectly healthy other than having a ruptured appendix at 9 years old. I also said you're really lucky not to have needed medical care, but before you die I bet you will. And I thought to myself but didn't say out loud that what about your parents and grandparents, siblings even children? Have they all been perfectly healthy until they died? Anyway a chairlift is not a safe place for real anger, but -- you also can't walk away from the other person. There's a lot of soul-sharing on rides like that.  </p>\n<p></p><div><img src=\"https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/02/19/whatMagaReallymeans.png\" />What Trump means by making America great.</div><p></p>","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"cd160a09ee5ec51123728a67d88f977e812f56f1a5fc94ebf778699d2cc7dd29","category":"default"}
