But this, to me, is one of the very few truly universal novels. The title itself, <em>Life and </em>Fate — it is about life and fate, but the novel is about so much more. It’s about war. It’s about slavery. It’s about love, motherhood, fatherhood, childbirth, rape, friendship, science, politics. How many novels, if any, can you think of that have all of those worlds in them in an interesting and insightful manner? Very few.</p>\r\n<p>The one that comes closest to it is, in fact, his model. That’s Tolstoy’s <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.britannica.com/topic/War-and-Peace\" target=\"_blank\"><em>War and Peace</em></a><em>, </em>a three-word title with an <em>and</em> in the middle and two important concepts. They’re both about war. They’re both about the invasions of Russia or the USSR. There’s a central family in both stories. The notion of what is fate or destiny is highly important to Tolstoy, as it is to Grossman, though they have different points of view.</p>\r\n<p>Napoleon plays a significant role in <em>War and Peace.</em> In <em>Life and Fate</em>, Hitler and Stalin make actual appearances in the novel, which I find shocking when I read it, like, here they are on the page, and it’s actually somewhat plausible. So, he’s modeling this, I think, after <em>War and Peace</em>. He actually pulls it off, which is a miracle. I think it is a novel comparable in quality and scope and import to Tolstoy’s <em>War and Peace</em>, which is sometimes called the greatest novel ever. So <em>that</em> is a pretty amazing achievement.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>And on some non-book issues:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>I think I should have said it’s a <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.statisticshowto.com/what-is-a-bimodal-distribution/\" target=\"_blank\">bimodal distribution</a>, that you go one way or another. Look at it this way: In the simplest Bayesian model, your views should be a random walk, that the recent evolution of your views shouldn’t predict where you’ll end up tomorrow. But that’s not the case, really, with anyone that I’ve ever met. There’s some kind of trend in your views. You’re either getting more fanatical, getting more moderate, getting more religious, more or less <em>something</em>.</p>\r\n<p>And that, to me, is one of the most interesting facts about human belief, is how hard it is to find belief as a random walk. So, what’s wrong with <em>all</em> of us? If you’re getting more moderate all the time, that’s wrong too. That’s a funny kind of, you could say, almost fanaticism, where you ought to say, “Well, I see the trend so I’m just going to leap to where I ought to be.” Then the next day, maybe 50 percent chance I’ll take a step back toward being more dogmatic or less moderate. But again, that’s not what we see from the moderates either.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERTS: </strong>I wonder how much of it is the fact that it’s really convenient to have a system, gives you something to shove into the box. You’ve got this black box that you take the world’s events and you’ve decided how they should be processed. Then something new comes along, and you know how to deal with that because you’ve got this box; you’ve got all these great examples from the past.</p>\r\n<p>At some point for me, I just started thinking that maybe the box doesn’t work all the time. I think a lot of people love the box. It’s a great source of comfort, whether it’s religion or ideology or other things. Maybe there’s just something peculiar about me. When you’re younger, certainty is deeply comforting because the world’s a bit too complicated to deal with. It still is, but I’m just less certain.</p>\r\n<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>There’s also a more charitable interpretation of what you’re describing. Think of yourself as working through problems, which is fine. Working through problems takes some time. You can’t every day pick up a new problem. The problems you’re working through as you — I wouldn’t say solve them, but as you <em>somewhat</em> make progress on them — that’s going to give you some persistence in the deltas of how your beliefs change.</p>\r\n<p>I’m not sure — the pure Bayesian model might just be wrong. It’s so far from actual human practice. Maybe we shouldn’t just damn humans for not meeting it, but realize there are structures to how you work through things, and they <em>are</em> going to imply certain trends that go on for periods of time.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Recommended, obviously.</p>\r\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/11/my-conversation-with-russ-roberts-on-vasily-grossmans-life-and-fate.html\">My Conversation with Russ Roberts on Vasily Grossman’s *Life and Fate*</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com\">Marginal REVOLUTION</a>.</p>\r\n<img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/908446673/0/marginalrevolution\" />\r\n<div><a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/908446673/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/908446673/marginalrevolution,\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/908446673/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/x.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/908446673/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/908446673/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/11/my-conversation-with-russ-roberts-on-vasily-grossmans-life-and-fate.html#comments\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/comments20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/11/my-conversation-with-russ-roberts-on-vasily-grossmans-life-and-fate.html/feed\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/commentsrss20.png\" /></a> \r\n<div><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/11/my-conversation-with-russ-roberts-on-vasily-grossmans-life-and-fate.html#comments\"><h3>Comments</h3></a><ul><li><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/11/my-conversation-with-russ-roberts-on-vasily-grossmans-life-and-fate.html#comment-160840260\">In reply to mort main.
