{"title":"How Do You Rhyme in Sign Language?","link":"https://kottke.org/24/03/how-do-you-rhyme-in-sign-language","date":1711671830000,"content":"\n        <p>A conversation at dinner with the kids left me wanting to know how to rhyme in sign language and when I found out, <a href=\"https://www.handspeak.com/learn/159/#\">it feels like it should have been obvious</a>. </p>\n\n<blockquote><p>In phonology (the study of the smallest units of language), the parts of a signed word are: handshape, location, palm orientation, movement, and non-manual signal. They are called parameters. Each parameter has a number of primes. In sign language specifically ASL, the same parameter in two or more words (signs) are repeated. The parts may be the same handshape, movement, and/or location, or combined, but the handshape rhyme is the most commonly used.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p><br />\nThis explanation of how to rhyme diddle and fiddle in ASL is illustrative. <br />\n</p>\n\n<p>And here’s an example of ASL poetry where you can clearly see the rhymes and music of the words in her poem. The poet, Christine Marshall, didn’t caption the poem and suggested viewers suggest a translation in the comments. The pinned translation is below. </p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>“Deaf Heart by Christine Marshall<br />\nA heartbeat pounds, within me strong<br />\nA beat consistent, as a song<br />\nBut singing yet, does not appease<br />\nThe world around me, just a tease<br />\nThey talk, they chat, they have a spat<br />\nWithout a sound, imagine that!<br />\nMy heartbeat now, the only tone<br />\nI sit, I stare, I’m all alone<br />\nThe beat it fades, a somber dirge<br />\nThen a shocking, shaking surge<br />\nMy eyes are struck, my senses peaked<br />\nI’ve never seen a sight so sweet<br />\nA language without metronome<br />\nA language I can call my own<br />\nThese people my experiences share<br />\nMy whole life passing, unaware<br />\nAll this time in quiet space<br />\nAll alone and out of place<br />\nNow my heart is torn in two<br />\n“Who am I?”, or “I AM WHO?”<br />\nI know my heart has made it clear<br />\nMy reservations disappear<br />\nI give myself to their embrace<br />\nTo ASL my saving grace<br />\nMy heart beats on and on in me<br />\nMy heart is Deaf, and now I see”</p>\n\n<p>See also, Jason’s post about ASL ‘<a href=\"http://kottke.org/15/05/eminems-lose-yourself-in-asl\">Lose Yourself</a>’, ASL <a href=\"http://kottke.org/16/09/asl-performance-of-alexander-hamilton\">Hamilton</a>, and <a href=\"https://kottke.org/17/04/translating-music-into-american-sign-language\">translating music</a>.</p>\n\n <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/American%20Sign%20Language\">American Sign Language</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/poetry\">poetry</a></p>\n\n <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/03/how-do-you-rhyme-in-sign-language\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Aaron Cohen","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"682e90eaee3e55c15c54465d33919d3bdeff2ee0d45d00edd4488617d09640d1","category":"default"}
