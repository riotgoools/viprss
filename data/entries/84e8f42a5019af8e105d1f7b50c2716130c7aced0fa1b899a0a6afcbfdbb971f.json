The astonishing thing is that not one human being who ever lived has chosen the body, brain, place, or time to be born into, and yet in the narrow band of freedom between these chance parameters, we must find a way to live lives of substance and sweetness. Chance deals the hand and we must play it, and in how we choose to play it lies the measure of who we are. </p>\n<p>Poet Aracelis Girmay and artist Diana Ejaita take up these immense, intimate questions with uncommon soulfulness in <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Kamau-Find-Way-Aracelis-Girmay/dp/1592703895/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>Kamau &amp; ZuZu Find a Way</em></strong></a> (<a href=\"https://search.worldcat.org/title/1393523860\" target=\"_blank\"><em>public library</em></a>) — a magical-realist story, lyrical and consummately illustrated, about a little boy and his grandmother who wake up one morning to find themselves on the Moon, pressed to make a home amid its inhospitable strangeness. What emerges is an ode to the stubborn courage of choosing to make a lush life out of even the most arid circumstances, to the defiant will of prevailing over the odds with fearless grace. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Kamau-Find-Way-Aracelis-Girmay/dp/1592703895/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/kamauandzuzu2.jpg?resize=680%2C383&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"680\" height=\"383\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/kamauandzuzu2.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/kamauandzuzu2.jpg?resize=320%2C180&amp;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/kamauandzuzu2.jpg?resize=600%2C338&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/kamauandzuzu2.jpg?resize=240%2C135&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/kamauandzuzu2.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w\" /></a></p>\n<p>The Moon has always been our nearest notion of another world and other worlds have always been one of our most imaginative ways of thinking about our own, about otherness itself. Five millennia after Johannes Kepler pioneered science fiction by challenging humanity’s unexamined assumptions with <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2019/12/26/katharina-kepler-witchcraft-dream/\">an allegory about life on the Moon</a>, here is an allegory that touches with great tenderness the global consequence of one of humanity’s most inhumane choices. But although the book celebrates the African diaspora — an undeniably singular experience — it has universal resonance for the broader experience of finding oneself transplanted, by choice or by circumstance, to a world so profoundly other that it appears alien, that one feels alien in it. (That is what America felt like when I arrived alone from Bulgaria in my late teens — incidentally, having been raised there largely by a grandmother named Zizi.)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Kamau-Find-Way-Aracelis-Girmay/dp/1592703895/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/kamauandzuzu1.jpg?resize=680%2C383&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"680\" height=\"383\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/kamauandzuzu1.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/kamauandzuzu1.jpg?resize=320%2C180&amp;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/kamauandzuzu1.jpg?resize=600%2C338&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/kamauandzuzu1.jpg?resize=240%2C135&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/kamauandzuzu1.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w\" /></a></p>\n<p>ZuZu, discomposed at first by how different the lunar landscape feels from their home village, sets out to grow the most vital nourishments for body and soul. “Hello there, Sister,” she says to the ground as she presses a kernel of corn into it, then a clothespin from her apron, then a photograph of her mother, then a square of cloth tucked inside her favorite book.</p>\n<p>In time, all kinds of things begin to grow.
