But they don’t think of my childhood watching my dad lose himself while arranging music on his piano or my grandfather tenderly nurturing plants in his ridiculously large garden. Instead, they imagine the stereotypes of J.D. Vance’s version of Appalachia, where the entire region is made up of poor rural white people consumed with violence who have no one to blame but themselves for their life circumstances.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Vance is of course the Republican VP candidate who once called Trump <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/jd-vance-once-compared-trump-hitler-now-they-are-running-mates-2024-07-15/\">“America’s Hitler”</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jul/16/jd-vance-abortion-rights-groups\">supports total abortion bans</a>, and says <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/jd-vance-defends-trump-claims-invoking-jean-carroll/story?id=106925954\">he would not have certified the results of the 2020 election</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Winchester goes on to recommend fifteen books about Appalachia that will provide a clearer view of the region and the people who live there. They include:</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0998904147/ref=nosim/0sil8\"><strong>What You Are Getting Wrong About Appalachia</strong></a> by Elizabeth Catte.</strong> “If you’re still wondering why Hillbilly Elegy is so problematic, I’d suggest starting with What You’re Getting Wrong About Appalachia.”</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B008X42HWO/ref=nosim/0sil8\"><strong>Appalachian Elegy: Poetry and Place</strong></a> by bell hooks.</strong> “In this poetry collection, she laments how Black Appalachians are all too often left out of narratives about Appalachia.”</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1949467007/ref=nosim/0sil8\"><strong>Any Other Place</strong></a> by Michael Croley.</strong> “Croley’s perspective as a Korean American informs his writing as his stories deal with many topics around race, identity, and belonging.”</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0525536906/ref=nosim/0sil8\"><strong>When These Mountains Burn</strong></a> by David Joy.</strong> “When These Mountains Burn features two men deeply impacted by the opioid crisis in Appalachia.”</p>\n\n<p>See also <a href=\"https://bittersoutherner.com/hillbillies-need-no-elegy-appalachian-reckoning\">Hillbillies Need No Elegy</a>, an excerpt from <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1946684791/ref=nosim/0sil8\">Appalachian Reckoning: A Region Responds to Hillbilly Elegy</a>.</p>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/books\">books</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/J.D.%20Vance\">J.D.
