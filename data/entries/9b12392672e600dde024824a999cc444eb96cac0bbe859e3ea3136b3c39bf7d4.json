I've designed a very innovative system that unfortunately the academics don't think is worth studying. It's utterly ridiculous. Who says you can only learn from systems developed at big companies or universities. I cover a lot of ground, it's true -- no one gave me permission to create <a href=\"http://frontier.userland.com\">Frontier</a>, but I didn't feel I needed permission. Or funding for that matter. I think what happened is Apple positioned us as less significant than their system scripting language, and people just accepted that, when Frontier is a far superior system. Anyway, the <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/frontier\">ideas are there</a> anyway, and you're welcome to learn from them.","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"9b12392672e600dde024824a999cc444eb96cac0bbe859e3ea3136b3c39bf7d4","category":"Sites"}
