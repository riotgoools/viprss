From the recording studio to the big screen, we explore this important cinematic milestone and celebrate the release that took over 15 months, 62 Lakota-Dakota language speakers, and the original Avengers team to come together and Assemble!</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>More details from the Lakota Times:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>On June 14th, 2024, Disney plus will release the Avengers film that will be dubbed in Lakota. Cyril “Chuck” Archambault, Ray Taken Alive, Dallas Nelson, Lawrence Archambault along with the Lakota Reclamation Project, Grey Willow Studios, students from McLaughlin school, elders from the Standing Rock community and many others have all worked very hard together to complete this project.</p>\n\n<p>A couple of years ago, Ray and Chuck talked about the idea of dubbing the Avengers movie. From there, Chuck spoke with Mark Ruffalo about the idea and Ruffalo said he will get back to them about it. Several months later, a meeting was set up with Marvel and Disney to discuss this idea. Not only did they approve of the project, but Marvel and Deluxe studios helped them through it.</p>\n\n<p>From there, they were able to receive a grant to help with funding, within the budgets they made sure that the Elders would be the highest paid in the project.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/C7AiMZQLAJ0/\">Here’s the poster for the Lakota dub</a>, which is now streaming on Disney+ (change the language option to Lakota).</p>\n\n<p>See also <a href=\"https://kottke.org/23/11/why-star-wars-was-dubbed-into-the-navajo-language\">Why Star Wars Was Dubbed Into the Navajo Language</a>.</p>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Avengers\">Avengers</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/language\">language</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Mark%20Ruffalo\">Mark Ruffalo</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/movies\">movies</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Native%20Americans\">Native Americans</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/remix\">remix</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/video\">video</a></p>\n\n         <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/07/the-avengers-assemble-for-lakota-dub\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"4913e94d4ab0d9ca66e8a61f4e000654985586810a2ae812260a9102a02851c9","category":"default"}
