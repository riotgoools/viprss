In <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@jamellebouie/video/7402378692212690219?lang=en\">a recent TikTok video</a> (<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/C-m_d5tRCol/\">mirrored on Instagram</a>), Bouie recommended a book called <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1781683131/ref=nosim/0sil8\">Racecraft: The Soul of Inequality in American Life</a> by sociologist Karen Fields and historian Barbara Fields and nutshelled the premise:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>The way the Fields sisters see it, and I think theyâ€™re right: race is a fiction, it doesnâ€™t exist biologically, itâ€™s a social construction, itâ€™s designed to categorize, and it often obscures far more than it explains. But racism is real, right? Racism, the action, is real, itâ€™s material, it affects peopleâ€™s lives, it has life or death stakes, it structures the way that we engage in, and are received by, the society in which we live.</p>\n\n<p>The example they give in the beginning of the book is: imagine a Black police officer is killed by one of his white colleagues. Heâ€™s undercover and heâ€™s shot and killed. The news would say that this police officer was killed because he was Black. But the Fields sisters would say, wait a sec. Did the white officer shoot because he was white? That the Blackness caused the death, that the whiteness caused the shooting? No, of course not. What happened was that a white officer relied on racist assumptions about people of African descent to come to a set of conclusions, then acted on those conclusions.</p></blockquote>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/books\">books</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Jamelle%20Bouie\">Jamelle Bouie</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Racecraft\">Racecraft</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/racism\">racism</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/USA\">USA</a></p>\n\n         <p>ðŸ’¬ <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/08/race-is-a-fiction-racism-is-real\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> â†’</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"a95e8b962ec9a4557e72566cf7a5b70ad39d46ce1ca59b03f08c474c20bb4a98","category":"default"}
