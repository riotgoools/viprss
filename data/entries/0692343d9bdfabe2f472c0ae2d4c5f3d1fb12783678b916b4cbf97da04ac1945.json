{"title":"Blogroll software update","link":"http://scripting.com/2024/04/02/005812.html?title=blogrollSoftwareUpdate","date":1712105892000,"content":"<p><img src=\"https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/04/01/appleRunner.png\" />We're starting to test the blogroll software with a few users, but we hit a problem before we began. The blogroll code includes the CSS for the Bootstrap Toolkit. I use it as if it were part of the OS, but not everyone does, and it changes the global values of things. So when you install it on a page that has its own ideas how things should work, you can get an unpleasant effect (to put it mildly). So I created a localized <a href=\"http://scripting.com/code/blogroll/smallbootstrap.css\">subset</a> of Bootstrap's styles, to be a better guest in other people's pages. That is now done. I expect we'll see more of that kind of thing. Web plugins are a new area for me. I guess that's pretty obvious. </p>","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"0692343d9bdfabe2f472c0ae2d4c5f3d1fb12783678b916b4cbf97da04ac1945","category":"default"}
