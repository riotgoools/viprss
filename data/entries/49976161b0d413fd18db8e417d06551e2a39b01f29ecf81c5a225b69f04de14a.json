But the conference is the heart of the festival, and requires special care.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year, for the first time, we went from two days of conference talks to just one day: seven new speakers, and three former speakers revisiting their old talks. After five years away, with one last festival, and only one day, I felt an intense pressure to make it count.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I’ve never wanted to micromanage speakers, and have always given a tremendous amount of creative freedom to the people we invite to speak about whatever they want. I invite creators whose work I love and, I think, will have something interesting to say. We always have a call where we talk about what the festival is about, the type of people who attend, and the kinds of talks that work well and those that don’t.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I usually explain that the conference is about, more than anything, the emotional experience of being an artist or creator on the internet, often covering the dark, difficult, painful challenges that they’ve dealt with, or are still struggling with, as a creator. “Big idea” TED-style talks don’t work well, and we avoid anything practical or industry-specific because the audience is so interdisciplinary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But after that, I let them loose unless they ask for additional guidance. When I decide the speaker order a few weeks before the festival, I only have a broad idea of what they’ll speaking about, so it’s always a bit magical to see themes emerge throughout the day, as one talk flows into the next.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many of this year’s themes were familiar to past XOXO attendees: mental health and burnout, exploitation under capitalism, harassment and online abuse, the important of community. Several speakers covered events that happened in the five years we were away: namely, the effects of the pandemic, the failures of legacy social networks, and the rise of alternative models for social media and journalism.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Appropriately for our last festival, the last two talks talked about legacy: how we’ll be remembered after we’re gone and the ephemeral nature of communities, from Cabel Sasser and Charlie Jane Anders respectively. Somehow, it all came together.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr />\n\n\n\n<p>As the last speaker at the last XOXO, Charlie Jane got the final word:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Connecting with other people is really pleasurable, even though it’s also really hard. And it is the thing that gives me hope for the future. Human connection fundamentally is the thing that makes me believe that we can survive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“So I’m here for gentle absurdity and tender weirdness. And I just don’t trust any version of the future where we don’t party and goof off and act ridiculous and rejoice, and just rejoice together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“So my final thought: I don’t believe in utopias. I don’t believe in dystopias. What I do believe in is people taking care of each other. So please, take care of each other. Thank you.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>My endless thanks to all the speakers, who were willing to be so vulnerable on stage, and the XOXO audience for being such a kind, empathetic audience for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More than anything, thanks to Andy for all his dedication and passion and endless work to make sure we proper closed the doors on a project we started 12 years ago, finally ending it on our own terms. It was an exhausting, life-affirming bundle of anxiety and wonder, and I’m going to miss it.</p>","author":"Andy Baio","siteTitle":"Waxy","siteHash":"35dc61c1bf207cf54e8192cba7836943b040f7b7156ad278540ab82731504f3e","entryHash":"49976161b0d413fd18db8e417d06551e2a39b01f29ecf81c5a225b69f04de14a","category":"Sites"}
