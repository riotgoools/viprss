It’s also resulted in a massive amount of “theater kid energy” — the memes, the cosplay, the sing-alongs. All of which, seems to be causing quite a bit of drama. In fact, the sing-alongs have inspired so much discourse that even The Rock<a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/dwayne-johnson-addresses-wicked-moana-debate-singing-cinema_uk_67446db7e4b03c8ec6f92d5e?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=everyone-s-a-theater-kid-now\" target=\"_blank\"> has weighed</a> in on it. (The Rock says you can sing “Defying Gravity” if you want.)</p><p>Writer Emily St. James pointed out how gendered this debate is.

In fact, it’s likely that the current secondhand embarrassment America is feeling about <i>Wicked</i> is actually self-loathing. Because now everyone is realizing that participating in any modern fandom requires acting like, well, a theater kid. Let’s walk this through.</p><p>First, we need to define what “theater kid energy” is: Earnest obsession, a willingness to embrace amateur reenactments in lieu of the real thing, a splash of camp, a devotion to canon, and a firm understanding of lore — whether its fictional lore or industry lore. </p><p>And back when <span><i>Wicked </i></span>opened on Broadway in 2003, when the world was still governed by things like newspaper circulations, box office numbers, and album sales, being a “theater kid” wasn’t easy. Decades before the internet and what we think of as “fandom” emerged, musical fans were already a massive subculture defined by inaccessibility. Most people couldn’t go see their favorite production on Broadway, so they made do with things like cast recordings and illegal bootlegs. Which forced theater fans to be both participatory and personal. They had to create their own spaces and practices in the absence of just watching the shows. God help anyone who has ever stumbled into a “Broadway karaoke” night unprepared.</p><div><img src=\"https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/3969a54b-c01d-4016-b114-373a756a9cd7/Screenshot_2024-11-25_at_3.27.24_PM.png?t=1732566469\" /><div><span><p>(<a href=\"https://x.com/barbzforbernie/status/1859721156703682685?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=everyone-s-a-theater-kid-now\" target=\"_blank\">x.com/barbzforbernie</a>)</p></span></div></div><p>One of the bizarre side effects of our streaming- and platform-driven digital media environment is that, even though your favorite TV shows and movies have never been so accessible, audiences are also more likely to not actually experience them in full. Also, by being gobbled up by large franchises, many of them are now just as long-running as Broadway productions, in a sense. The result is a world of mass entertainment reduced to something you do or consume through short clips on your phone. </p><p>Algorithmic social platforms like Facebook and X have been<a href=\"https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2023/08/17/media/facebook-referral-traffic-reliable-sources?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=everyone-s-a-theater-kid-now\" target=\"_blank\"> suppressing</a> outgoing links<a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2023/10/03/musk-x-links-long-form?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=everyone-s-a-theater-kid-now\" target=\"_blank\"> for years</a>, prioritizing the conversation about a thing over actually going and seeing the thing. And more recently, TikTok has taken it to another level. The app’s autoplaying, algorithmic presentation is designed to make people feel like watching and making content are one and the same. You could sit and watch all eight episodes of Disney’s <i>Star Wars</i> spin-off, <i>The Acolyte,</i> but chances are you didn’t. Though, you may have seen <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/discover/acolyte-star-wars-head-but?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=everyone-s-a-theater-kid-now\" target=\"_blank\">the cool headbutt scene</a>. TV shows, movies, gambling, dating apps — you are likely consuming all of that via vertical videos first, if not completely.</p><p>This doesn’t mean the actual source is abandoned entirely. Just look at all the overrun “<a href=\"https://inews.co.uk/news/world/europe-hidden-gems-ravaged-tiktok-tourism-3214907?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=everyone-s-a-theater-kid-now\" target=\"_blank\">hidden gems</a>” and<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/food/2024/08/22/keith-lee-tiktok-restaurant-fairfax-okonomi/?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=everyone-s-a-theater-kid-now\" target=\"_blank\"> lines around the block for food</a> caused by TikTok trends — which aren’t so dissimilar to the irl lines you’d see on Broadway. Viewers want to make the pilgrimage themselves, which is why those lines get so long and also why the <span><i>Wicked </i></span>musical has never closed.</p><p>So, yes, The Rock is right, singing in your chair at <i>Wicked</i> is fine. In fact, it’s the way everything works now. Dress up and yell at the screen (though, maybe don’t become an <a href=\"https://x.com/nat_dwbua_/status/1860541618060943677?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=everyone-s-a-theater-kid-now\" target=\"_blank\">amateur camripper</a>). The trend line is clear. Our entertainment is becoming more public and more performative. And if you’re reading this, it means you care about things enough that you’re probably not all that different. Like it or not, we’re all theater kids now.</p><hr /><p><i>The following is a paid ad.

If you’d like to sample the cringe from a safe distance, the screenshot above is indicative of the general vibe.</p><p>Musk did take a break from his posting mania <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/amandamull.bsky.social/post/3lbron3br6k2q?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=everyone-s-a-theater-kid-now\" target=\"_blank\">to confirm</a> that, yes, links are being algorithmically downgraded right now. So that little content hack where you link in the replies of your own post does seem to work.</p><p>What is still unclear, however, is why X seems to be removing followers from Palestinian reporter Younis Tirawi.

In the replies to Toler’s post, other users are saying similar “bugs” mysteriously have affected other prominent Palestinian accounts before, as well.</p><hr /><h2>Some Weird Stuff Happening on Bluesky Right Now</h2><p>Meanwhile, over on the other, better Twitter, things are escalating as you might expect.

And while right-wingers are having a tough time not immediately getting banned, radical centrists like Matt Yglesias are now just <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/leahmcelrath.bsky.social/post/3lbqusbkyvc2f?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=everyone-s-a-theater-kid-now\" target=\"_blank\">straight up admitting</a> that they want to join Bluesky because arguing with leftists is more fun that staring at conservative slop on X.</p><p>You know who hasn’t moved over to Bluesky yet? Chinese state media and propaganda ministers. They’re actually currently on X <a href=\"https://x.com/SariArhoHavren/status/1860720233335419174?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=everyone-s-a-theater-kid-now\" target=\"_blank\">begging</a> Musk to meddle with the US military.

What does that mean? The simplest explanation is that the part of the Bluesky API that hosts images can also host code. It won’t show up in any app, but you can read how Mangum did it and also check out his website <a href=\"https://danielmangum.com/posts/this-website-is-hosted-on-bluesky/?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=everyone-s-a-theater-kid-now\" target=\"_blank\">by clicking here</a>.</p><hr /><h2>A Redditor Has A Very Good Question About Washington, DC</h2><div><img src=\"https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/89999da6-a29d-481a-bbf0-7a9379b3567a/Screenshot_2024-11-25_at_12.56.59_PM.png?t=1732557446\" /><div><span><p>(<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/1gxmqly/any_barsplaces_in_dc_where_i_can_do_this/?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=everyone-s-a-theater-kid-now\" target=\"_blank\">r/washingtondc</a>)</p></span></div></div><p>According to the commenters, there are a few good places in DC to do this.

Let’s Investigate.</h2><p>Here’s a fascinating conundrum for you. Jack Antonoff has producing credits across the majority of the songs on Kendrick Lamar’s new album, <i>GNX</i>. It’s enough to have many people <a href=\"https://x.com/cheapjumpscare/status/1860054142032707859?s=12&amp;t=GArJOEJ41SKT7sLfzFsugQ&amp;utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=everyone-s-a-theater-kid-now\" target=\"_blank\">bravely ask</a>, “if Jack Antonoff is good then why does Taylor Swift sound… like that?” </p><p>I wanted to revisit some things that I’ve written about Antonoff in the past. I’ve previously <a href=\"https://www.garbageday.email/p/the-king-of-brand-safe-nothingness?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=everyone-s-a-theater-kid-now\" target=\"_blank\">called him</a> “the king of brand safe nothingness,” which, ok, a little brutal. But I have <a href=\"https://www.garbageday.email/p/various-conservative-grievances-and?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=everyone-s-a-theater-kid-now\" target=\"_blank\">also argued</a> that Antonoff is probably very fun to work with in the studio and that he’s “clearly more interested in what he can do by manipulating existing sounds and layering weird noises than with what he can get out of performers in the studio.” Which is much more suited for hip hop than pop actually. But, also, who knows maybe he just told Antonoff no more reverb.</p><hr /><h2>A Quick Test Of How Online You Are</h2><div><img src=\"https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/c4938a99-e43c-4c6e-8355-e6b5cadd0a64/Screenshot_2024-11-25_at_1.01.58_PM.png?t=1732557753\" /><div><span><p>(<a href=\"https://x.com/sayamoroll/status/1860062180965765529?s=12&amp;t=GArJOEJ41SKT7sLfzFsugQ&amp;utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=everyone-s-a-theater-kid-now\" target=\"_blank\">x.com/sayamoroll</a>)</p></span></div></div><hr /><div><h2><span>Did you know Garbage Day has a merch store?</span></h2><div><img src=\"https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/51eefe2c-07bf-408c-a27d-887ea8b2f580/Screenshot_2024-05-23_at_4.33.09_PM.png?t=1716493112\" /></div><p><span><b><a href=\"https://internetgarbage.creator-spring.com/?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=everyone-s-a-theater-kid-now\" target=\"_blank\">You can check it out here!</a></b></span></p><hr /></div><h2>Some Stray Links</h2><ul><li><p><a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/article/anthony-jeselnik-bones-and-all-stand-up-comedy-profile.html?utm_source=pocket_shared\" target=\"_blank\">“‘I’m Not Letting You Laugh at Me.
