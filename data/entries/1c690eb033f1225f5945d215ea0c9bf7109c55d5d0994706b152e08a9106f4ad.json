It’s been a very busy (lots of movement, too much movement) month this past month. More regular Ridgelines incoming.\nThe Kiso-ji road runs from the edge of Shiojiri in Nagano, in a northeast-southwest direction through a thin valley shunted between stretches of the Japan Alps: the Kiso Mountains, Mount Utsugi, Mount Anbeiji, Mount Surikogi, Mount Okusangi, and more.
