{"title":"Endling: A Poem","link":"https://www.themarginalian.org/2024/02/16/endling/","date":1708102588000,"content":"<p>I turned the corner one afternoon to find my neighborhood grocer gone. No warning, just gone — padlocked and boarded off, closed for good, a long chain of habit suddenly severed. </p>\n<p>We know that <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2022/04/07/the-more-loving-one-auden-universe-in-verse/\">entropy drags everything toward dissolution</a>, that life is a vector pointed at loss, but how rarely we realize that the lasts are last, how staggering the turning of those corners. The friend you embrace in a casual parting not knowing it is the final farewell. The lover you kiss not knowing you will never touch again. Your mother answering the phone in a voice you’ve known forever, a voice you don’t know you will never again hear.</p>\n<p>Even science has tenderness for these unbidden finalities in its term for the last known survivor of a species: <em>endling</em> — an end abrupt yet somehow endearing in its smallness, its particularity, in the way a tragedy so vast and collective can culminate on the minute scale of the individual, the scale on which our lives ultimately unfold. </p>\n<p>And so, a poem:</p>\n<p></p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>ENDLING</strong><br />\n<em>by Maria Popova</em></p>\n<p>Unspooling from a reel<br />\nin the sound archive<br />\nof the British Library<br />\nis the syncopating chirp of<br />\nthe last <em>Moho braccatus</em> —<br />\na small Hawaiian bird<br />\n     now extinct.</p>\n<p>After centuries of humans<br />\nsilenced the species<br />\n     with civilization,<br />\nafter a hurricane<br />\nkilled the last female<br />\n     in 1982,<br />\nhe alone was left<br />\nto sing the final song<br />\n     of his kind —<br />\na mating call for<br />\na world void of mate.</p>\n<p>In ten billion years,<br />\nthe Sun will burn out.<br />\nIn a hundred billion,<br />\nthe galaxies will drift apart<br />\nand take away the light,<br />\nleaving the night sky<br />\nblack as the inside<br />\n     of a skull.<br />\nIn time,<br />\nall the energy<br />\nof the cosmos<br />\nwill dissipate<br />\nuntil none is left<br />\n     to succor life<br />\nas the universe goes on expanding<br />\n     into eternity.</p>\n<p>Somewhere along the way,<br />\nthere will have been a creature<br />\nto think the last thought<br />\nand feel the last feeling<br />\nand sing the last song<br />\n     of life.</p>\n<p>And it will have been beautiful,<br />\nthis brief movement of being<br />\nin the silent symphony<br />\n     of forever,<br />\nand it will have been merciful<br />\nthat only hindsight<br />\never knows<br />\n     each last.</p></blockquote>\n<hr /><h3>donating = loving</h3><p>For seventeen years, I have been spending hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars each month composing <em>The Marginalian</em> (which <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2021/10/22/brain-pickings-becoming-the-marginalian/\">bore the outgrown name <em>Brain Pickings</em></a> for its first fifteen years).
