The mechanisms for obtaining consent, particularly around <em>“affirmative express consent,”</em> may leave room for interpretation, providing maneuvering room, not ideal.  Exemptions for small businesses or specific data processing activities, if too broad or vaguely defined, can serve as unintended backdoors for lesser privacy protections.  Carve a proper lane between need and burden here.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>The act’s stipulations on data minimization, retention, and the responsibilities of third parties and service providers are crucial; loopholes in these areas could lead to more extensive data collection, retention, and sharing practices than intended.\n<p></p></em></li>\n<li>The requirements for entities to implement technical and organizational security measures need to be explicit and stringent to avoid varied interpretations that could weaken data security practices.</li>\n<li>International data transfer provisions need to set clear and high standards to prevent data protection from being undercut by transfers to jurisdictions with lesser privacy safeguards.</li>\n<li>Make sure the rights of individuals to sue or if prohibitions on arbitration clauses are strong, ensuring individuals’ avenues for redress and enforcement of their privacy rights.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>blow by blow…</p>\n<h3>Establishes Foundational Uniform National Data Privacy Rights for Americans:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Control of Personal Data:</strong> The Act places individuals in control of their personal data, offering rights to access, correct, delete, and export their data, as outlined in <strong>Section 5 (Individual Control Over Covered Data)</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>SEC. 5.
