This Flickr account <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/50749457@N02/albums/72157629082469698/\">has scans of every card in the deck</a>, including both jokers. Each suit corresponds to a different aspect of the program:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>These space cards tell a story â€” the story of Americaâ€™s man-in-space programs. The hearts deal with the human element, the clubs portray the sciences, the spades show products, and the diamonds depict modern aerospace management without which the other three elements could not be successfulâ€¦</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>If youâ€™d like your own factory-sealed deck, <a href=\"https://www.ebay.com/itm/115861158965\">you can buy one on eBay for $249</a>.
