which i also had the pleasure of doing design + dev for! my favorite is this fish one. from 42 embeds to 100, they all made my computer crash and required the most powerful imacs in the gallery to display!!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>i like thinking of lag, glitch, and delays as constant variables in any web-based work: it‚Äôs why most of my work is textual and minimalist in design, with a fraction testing the limits of the computer. i love the idea of work that is designed to be malleable: that if i were to repurpose this for viewing in different spaces, i‚Äôd have to rearrange the strokes of these ‚Äòlandscapes‚Äô (which were already inherently very tediously/meticulously arranged, playing with filters, scale, rotation). i presented it with galleryspeak, talking about how the dimensions are variable (duh!), just barely retrofitting barebones youtube embeds to collapse the videos from their former containers (and depending on speed/machine, it‚Äôs not so obvious that they‚Äôre youtube embeds), using the count of embeds to emphasize the <em>heft</em> of the work. i love the fact that the landscape is lifelike: dying as the videos get taken down, erroring out..</p>\n\n\n\n<p><img
