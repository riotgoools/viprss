{"title":"The Pixel Painter","link":"https://kottke.org/24/02/the-pixel-painter","date":1708114092000,"content":"\n        <p>This is an image created by <a href=\"https://thepixelpainter.com/\">Hal Lasko</a> in Microsoft Paint:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/plus/misc/images/ms-paint-coaster.jpg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"608\" alt=\"a pixelated illustration of a roller coaster\" /></p>\n\n<p>Lasko was a retired graphic designer &amp; typographer who found a new passion when he received a computer for his 85th birthday, which came preloaded with Microsoft Paint. This short film tells the story of The Pixel Painter:</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<blockquote><p>That all changed for Hal when his family gave him a computer as an 85th birthday present. His new PC came loaded with Microsoft Paint software, a program developed in the 1980‚Äôs. The program is more kitsch than cutting edge, but it‚Äôs easy interface and pixel precision allowed Hal to journey down a new artistic path with a style many consider ‚Äúretro cool‚Äù.</p>\n\n<p>In his last year of life, he had his first solo gallery show, spoke at a conference and was featured in a Super Bowl commercial. He passed away just shy of his 99th birthday in 2014, leaving us with a legacy that passion knows no age, and for Hal, the proof of that is surely in the pixels.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>You can still <a href=\"https://thepixelpainter.com/\">buy prints of Lasko‚Äôs work on his website</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Fun fact: the short film uses <a href=\"https://kottke.org/plus/type/silkscreen/\">my Silkscreen font</a> in it. It‚Äôs fun to see it still popping up in places.
