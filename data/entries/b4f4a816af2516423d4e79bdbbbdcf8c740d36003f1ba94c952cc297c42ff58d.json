She had worked at a knitting factory and as a housekeeper. She had written poetry, publishing a collection titled <em>Life</em> in the interlude between the two World Wars. Having lost two of her siblings to childhood illness, then both her surviving brother and her father to suicide when she was seventeen, she had coped with the physical fragility of life and the spiritual difficulty of bearing our mortality by becoming a healer. Her friends called her Penta, from the Pythagorean symbol for health — a pentagram drawn with a single line. </p>\n<p>Inspired by the Swiss Renaissance alchemist, philosopher, and physician Paracelsus, who fused the divinations and prophecies with the building blocks of the scientific method in his experiments and observations in chemistry and biology that pioneered the field of toxicology, Penta came to see the physical and spiritual dimensions of reality as one. </p>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/EmmaKunz_TheMarginalian.jpg?resize=680%2C971&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"680\" height=\"971\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/EmmaKunz_TheMarginalian.jpg?w=828&amp;ssl=1 828w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/EmmaKunz_TheMarginalian.jpg?resize=320%2C457&amp;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/EmmaKunz_TheMarginalian.jpg?resize=600%2C857&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/EmmaKunz_TheMarginalian.jpg?resize=240%2C343&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/EmmaKunz_TheMarginalian.jpg?resize=768%2C1096&amp;ssl=1 768w\" /><figcaption>Emma Kunz</figcaption></figure>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2022/02/04/universe-in-verse-bloom/\">Like Emily Dickinson</a>, she was inspired by botany, saw in plants a model of the mind a century before <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2024/05/24/the-light-eaters/\">the new science of plant intelligence</a>, and filled her garden with <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2020/01/29/elizabeth-blackwell-curious-herbal/\">medicinal plants</a> to use in tonics and ointments. Like Hilma af Klint and <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/tag/agnes-martin/\">Agnes Martin</a>, she found in geometry a poetic form through which to explore metaphysical questions of truth and meaning. </p>\n<p>As a schoolchild, she had delighted in using a pendulum to make drawings in her exercise books, but it was not until midlife that she found in this process a portal to a larger world of ideas. In 1938, using a silver pendulum with a jade end she believed was guided by energy fields — a technique she termed <em>radiesthesia</em> — she began making large-scale drawings in pencil and crayon on graph paper, hundreds of them, to divine diagnoses of physical and psychic ailments and heal people, often with results bordering on the miraculous. While working on a drawing, sometimes for two continuous days, she neither slept nor ate, subsisting on water and the spiritual energies she believed guided her.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/emmakunz5.jpg?resize=680%2C692&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"680\" height=\"692\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/emmakunz5.jpg?w=2362&amp;ssl=1 2362w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/emmakunz5.jpg?resize=320%2C326&amp;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/emmakunz5.jpg?resize=600%2C610&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/emmakunz5.jpg?resize=240%2C244&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/emmakunz5.jpg?resize=768%2C781&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/emmakunz5.jpg?resize=1510%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 1510w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/emmakunz5.jpg?resize=2013%2C2048&amp;ssl=1 2013w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/emmakunz5.jpg?w=1360&amp;ssl=1 1360w\" /></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/emmakunz6.jpg?resize=680%2C685&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"680\" height=\"685\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/emmakunz6.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/emmakunz6.jpg?resize=320%2C323&amp;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/emmakunz6.jpg?resize=600%2C605&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/emmakunz6.jpg?resize=240%2C242&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/emmakunz6.jpg?resize=768%2C774&amp;ssl=1 768w\" /></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/emmakunz7.jpg?resize=680%2C710&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"680\" height=\"710\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/emmakunz7.jpg?w=959&amp;ssl=1 959w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/emmakunz7.jpg?resize=320%2C334&amp;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/emmakunz7.jpg?resize=600%2C626&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/emmakunz7.jpg?resize=240%2C251&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/emmakunz7.jpg?resize=768%2C802&amp;ssl=1 768w\" /></p>\n<p>There is something astral in the exquisite precision of her drawings, emanating the musicality of mathematics and the sacred symmetry of mandalas, emanating the animating force of her practice both as artist and as healer — a search for harmony and transformation, a reverence for the power of connection as an organizing principle of reality. She saw mystery as the key to revelation and sought it in the language of signs and symbols, in the essences and forms of plants and crystals, in the relationships between numbers. </p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/emmakunz9.jpg?resize=680%2C708&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"680\" height=\"708\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/emmakunz9.jpg?w=962&amp;ssl=1 962w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/emmakunz9.jpg?resize=320%2C333&amp;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/emmakunz9.jpg?resize=600%2C624&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/emmakunz9.jpg?resize=240%2C250&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/emmakunz9.jpg?resize=768%2C799&amp;ssl=1 768w\" /></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/emmakunz10.jpg?resize=680%2C680&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"680\" height=\"680\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/emmakunz10.jpg?w=1001&amp;ssl=1 1001w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/emmakunz10.jpg?resize=320%2C320&amp;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/emmakunz10.jpg?resize=600%2C600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/emmakunz10.jpg?resize=240%2C240&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/emmakunz10.jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w\" /></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/emmakunz3.jpg?resize=680%2C669&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"680\" height=\"669\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/emmakunz3.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/emmakunz3.jpg?resize=320%2C315&amp;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/emmakunz3.jpg?resize=600%2C590&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/emmakunz3.jpg?resize=240%2C236&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/emmakunz3.jpg?resize=768%2C755&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/emmakunz3.jpg?resize=1536%2C1511&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/emmakunz3.jpg?w=1360&amp;ssl=1 1360w\" /></p>\n<p>Penta — who appears in Jennifer Higgie’s altogether wonderful <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Other-Side-Story-Women-Spirit/dp/1639365435/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>The Other Side: A Story of Women in Art and the Spirit World</em></strong></a> (<a href=\"https://search.worldcat.org/title/1384414932\" target=\"_blank\"><em>public library</em></a>) — considered herself not an artist but a researcher.
