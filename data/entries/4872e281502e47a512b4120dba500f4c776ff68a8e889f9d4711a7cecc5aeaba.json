(Justine II),” which I love. A feature on Brown in <a href=\"https://www.independenthq.com/features/delia-brown-society-portraits-and-the-divine-feminine\">Independent Art Fair magazine</a> also includes an awesome painting of hers from 2000 called “What, Are You Jealous?” (probably NSFW).</p>\n\n<p>Someday — someday! — I want to turn down an invitation to something because “I can’t, I’m sitting for my portrait at that time.”</p>\n\n<p>Elsewhere in portraits: <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/15/style/king-charles-iii-portrait-jonathan-yeo-red.html?unlocked_article_code=1.sE0.c3R7.IxetnaPVvE7R&amp;smid=url-share\">King Charles’s, by Jonathan Yeo</a>. “In his interview with the BBC,” the NYT’s Vanessa Friedman writes, “Mr. Yeo noted that when the king first saw the painting, he was ‘initially mildly surprised by the strong color,’ which may be an understatement.”</p>\n\n<p>Many more of Brown’s paintings can be found on her <a href=\"http://www.deliabrown.net/Delia_Brown/Home.html\">website</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/deliabrown\">Instagram</a>. </p>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/art\">art</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Delia%20Brown\">Delia Brown</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/painting\">painting</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/portraits\">portraits</a></p>\n\n         <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/05/delia-browns-portraits\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Edith Zimmerman","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"4872e281502e47a512b4120dba500f4c776ff68a8e889f9d4711a7cecc5aeaba","category":"default"}
