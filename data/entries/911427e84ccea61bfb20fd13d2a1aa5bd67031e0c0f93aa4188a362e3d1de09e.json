{"title":"About this book","link":"https://sive.rs/hy1","date":1527811200000,"content":"<p>\nIn my first book, <i><a href=\"https://sive.rs/a\">Anything You Want</a></i>, I told the story of how I started, grew, and sold my company.\n</p><p>\nAs part of selling the company, I signed a non-compete agreement that said I couldn’t do the one thing I’d been doing since I was twenty-seven years old.\nSo I had to make a real change in my life.\n</p><p>\nI thought a lot about <strong>what’s worth doing, fixing faulty thinking, and making things happen</strong>.\nFor the next ten years, I wrote for hours a day in my private journal, asking myself questions and answering them.\nWhen these thoughts seemed useful to others, I’d turn them into articles, which are now the chapters of <a href=\"https://sive.rs/n\">this book</a>.\n</p><p>\nI write succinctly because I’m only introducing ideas.\nYou can apply them to your life better than I can.\nBut if you want to hear more thoughts or talk about them, go to the URL at the end of each chapter:\n<strong>\n(sive.rs/_____)\n</strong>\nThere you’ll find many interesting comments about that idea, and you can post your own.\n</p><p>\nOr just say hello at <strong><a href=\"https://sive.rs/contact\">sive.rs/contact</a></strong>\nI love hearing from people who have found my work.\nI reply to every email.\n</p><p>\n— Derek Sivers, Oxford, England, 2019\n</p>","author":"Derek Sivers","siteTitle":"Derek Sivers","siteHash":"4098504c0d0759e13901f29e63f7d7dbb1d972a078c6dc4560660f373da5c25e","entryHash":"911427e84ccea61bfb20fd13d2a1aa5bd67031e0c0f93aa4188a362e3d1de09e","category":"default"}
