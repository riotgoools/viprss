He was a great liberal. He loved free speech, very broad-minded, as you know much better than I do. But he, on economics, was weak. Or no?</p>\r\n<p><strong>ZAKARIA: </strong>Oh, no, you’re entirely right. By the way, I would say the same is true of my father, with whom I had many, many such conversations. You’d find this interesting, Tyler. My father was a young Indian nationalist who — as he once put it to me — made the most important decision in his life, politically, when he was 13 or 14 years old, which was, as a young Indian Muslim, he chose Nehru’s vision of secular democracy as the foundation of a nation rather than <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-40961603\" target=\"_blank\">Jinnah’s view of religious nationalism</a>. He chose India rather than Pakistan as an Indian Muslim.</p>\r\n<p>He was politically so interesting and forward-leaning, but he was a hopeless social — a sort of social democrat, but veering towards socialism. Both these guys were. Here’s why, I think. For that whole generation of people — by the way, my father got a scholarship to London University and went to study with <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.britannica.com/biography/Harold-Joseph-Laski\" target=\"_blank\">Harold Laski</a>, the great British socialist economist. Laski told him, “You are actually not an economist; you are a historian.” So, my father went on and got a PhD at London University in Indian history.</p>\r\n<p>That whole generation of Indians who wanted independence were imbued with . . . There were two things going on. One, the only people in Britain who supported Indian independence were the Labour Party and the <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.britannica.com/topic/Fabian-Society\" target=\"_blank\">Fabian Socialists</a>. All <em>their</em> allies were all socialists. There was a common cause and there was a symbiosis because these were your friends, these were your allies, these were the only people supporting you, the cause that mattered the most to you in your life.</p>\r\n<p>The second part was, a lot of people who came out of third-world countries felt, “We are never going to catch up with the West if we just wait for the market to work its way over hundreds of years.” They looked at, in the ’30s, the Soviet Union and thought, “This is a way to accelerate modernization, industrialization.” They all were much more comfortable with the idea of something that sped up the historical process of modernization.</p>\r\n<p>My own view was, that was a big mistake, though I do think there are elements of what the state was able to do that perhaps were better done in a place like South Korea than in India, but that really explains it.</p>\r\n<p>My father was in Britain in ’45 as a student. As a British subject then, you got to vote in the election if you were in London, if you were in Britain. I said to him, “Who did you vote for in the 1945 election?” Remember, this is the famous <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://theconversation.com/when-a-winner-becomes-a-loser-winston-churchill-was-kicked-out-of-office-in-the-british-election-of-1945-129746\" target=\"_blank\">election</a> right after World War II, in which Churchill gets defeated, and he gets up the next morning and looks at the papers, and his wife says to him, “Darling, it’s a blessing in disguise.” He says, “Well, at the moment it seems very effectively disguised.”</p>\r\n<p>My father voted in that election. I said to him, “You’re a huge fan of Churchill,” because I’d grown up around all the Churchill books, and my father could quote the speeches. I said, “Did you vote for Churchill?” He said, “Oh good lord, no.” I said, “Why? I thought you were a great admirer of his.” He said, “Look, on the issue that mattered most to me in life, he was an unreconstructed imperialist. A vote for Labour was a vote for Indian independence. A vote for Churchill was a vote for the continuation of the empire.” That, again, is why their friends were all socialists.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Excellent throughout.  And don’t forget Fareed’s new book — discussed in the podcast — <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.amazon.com/Age-Revolutions-Progress-Backlash-Present/dp/0393239233/ref=sr_1_2?crid=1Y1M4HF6NSBAA&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.ZKoyzWenAv4AbsbfBp-du90j28J8rKar_a1oHj4_fYfFJk6WG7G4m_i9gKHM9mdsTZunux5cQAwTVB-XJcYHyytFioT8QaeRBMEO_MeW7h6Y7CpkRQJZnnk_NWqHRE3OB_Q51ACcOSh_hOu4pVc4OGZ68k8nuawxUwWwcJvD_N_Vrmdj5X3_b5EzF7ORt3It8-uvTDHkgAw6__kqmZewPQbFxZRp2fVxpT5vC1n19Cw9EYrZIz60m7zD-Mh1Y7rQd0u8g0ni9xWeHnsbuz9-gUjTUP75RswzkYLfUrHa33A.vPo7dvqx-QpkhIMIuiyX93LeIN9VVvtYUWuhFN9YMEg&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=fareed+zakaria&amp;qid=1711560935&amp;sprefix=fareed+zakaria%2Caps%2C81&amp;sr=8-2\" target=\"_blank\">Age of Revolutions: Progress and Backlash from 1600 to the Present</a>.</p>\r\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/03/my-conversation-with-fareed-zakaria.html\">My Conversation with Fareed Zakaria</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com\">Marginal REVOLUTION</a>.</p>\r\n<img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/874581737/0/marginalrevolution\" />\r\n<div><a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/874581737/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/874581737/marginalrevolution,\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/874581737/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/x.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/874581737/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/874581737/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/03/my-conversation-with-fareed-zakaria.html#comments\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/comments20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/03/my-conversation-with-fareed-zakaria.html/feed\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/commentsrss20.png\" /></a> \r\n<div><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/03/my-conversation-with-fareed-zakaria.html#comments\"><h3>Comments</h3></a><ul><li><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/03/my-conversation-with-fareed-zakaria.html#comment-160736410\">In reply to M.
