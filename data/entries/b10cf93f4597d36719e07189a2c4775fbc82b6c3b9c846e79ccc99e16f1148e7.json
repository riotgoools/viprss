However, a new year symbolizes\nrebirth and new beginnings. A chance to begin anewâ€¦and so on. With that said,\nhere is a list of things I want to accomplish in the new year.</p>\n<h2>Learning</h2>\n<p>iOS development has always been something on my \"yeah, at some point\" mental\nlist but in the past week I realized that I need to learn it to create a client\nfor my social network. I purchased some courses from Ray Wenderlich's site<a href=\"https://store.raywenderlich.com\">1</a>\neons ago and am <em>just now</em> going through it. That reminds me, I have <em>plenty</em>\nof courses purchased from Udemy that I have not revisited (8 of them involve\nBlender and/or using Blender with Unity)â€¦I will get back to them, at some\npoint.</p>\n<h2>Product Launches</h2>\n<p>I had an epiphany a couple weeks ago regarding online products and services.\nWhen you distill them to the basics, <em>what people are paying for/getting is\naccess to an API wrapped in a UI</em>.</p>\n<p>This gave me the sudden realization that a majority of my planned products\n(projects really) have suffered from me getting stuck on the UI. A friend\ncalled it \"analysis paralysis\" and that sums it up <em>perfectly</em>. I came into the\ntech space via web design and development, so I am trained to think of the UI\nfirst and foremost. However, as the back-end developer as well I have to\nadjust my thinking to prioritize the functionality over how pretty something\nlooks/feels. This may sound like a no-brainer to you, dear reader, but when you\nare inside your own head it is not so obvious. The functionality informs the\nUI/UX and vice-versa, it's a balance.</p>\n<p>Here is a non-exhaustive list of just SOME of my languished projects I would\nlove to turn into products:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>web browser</li>\n<li>domain portfolio management tool</li>\n<li>web app deployer</li>\n<li>analytics service</li>\n<li>operating system</li>\n<li>process management for servers</li>\n<li>content-management system</li>\n<li>IMAP server proxy and client</li>\n<li>social network</li>\n<li>eCommerce platform</li>\n<li>lifestyle brand</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some of these are already in active progress and I think it is totally possible\nto achieve 90% of this list by next year's end.</p>\n<h2>Music</h2>\n<p>I used to produce music and rap over my own beats and it gave me another outlet\nto express myself. Retro/futuristic/jazzy beats and (I thought) dope rhymes,\nhaha! A number of factors contributed to the demise of that particular\nactivity, least of which was starting a family. In my pre-family days I could\nhave complete silence and uninterrupted workflow for hours. That simply does\nnot exist for me now.</p>\n<p>I <em>think</em> I could get back to creating music in many small spurts of time. What\na luxury, time is.</p>\n<h2>Video</h2>\n<p>I upgrade my iPhone every year and the camera gets better year over year.\nAdditionally, I have a couple ideas for short films so I should be taking full\nadvantage of this fantastically capable device. I have a Vimeo account for a\n<em>reason</em>. Yeesh.</p>\n<h2>Andâ€¦</h2>\n<p>As usual, I just want to become a better version of myself and hopefully not\ndeal with much strife on the way. Parenting is hard, relationships are hard,\nLIFE is hard. My quest to make things a bit easier, continues. ðŸ•¸</p>\n<hr />\n","author":"","siteTitle":"the webb blog","siteHash":"d87386c8de21b16d23a4d22ceb0991728c5b4e4486d627490c6fcde14e563300","entryHash":"b10cf93f4597d36719e07189a2c4775fbc82b6c3b9c846e79ccc99e16f1148e7","category":"Sites"}
