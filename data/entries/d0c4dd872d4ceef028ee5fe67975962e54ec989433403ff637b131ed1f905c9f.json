Nothing. What can we say to God? Everything. Poems to God are prayer. And if there are no prayers nowadays (except Rilke’s… I know of none), it is not because we don’t have anything to say to God, nor because we have no one to say this anything to — there is something and there is someone — but because we haven’t the conscience to praise and pray God in the same language we’ve used for centuries to praise and pray absolutely everything. In our age, to have the courage for direct speech to God (for prayer) we must either not know what poems are, or forget.</p></blockquote>\n<p>A century later, in the atmosphere of Western consumer capitalism with its cult of the self, it is even more countercultural to <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2024/02/18/hesse-soul/\">speak about the soul</a> — perhaps the last human holdout against commodification, too private and furtive to be turned into a marketable data point.
