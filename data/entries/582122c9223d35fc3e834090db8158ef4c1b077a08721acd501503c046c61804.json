When passengers entered the cab, he would proudly announce, “You’re riding with the Street Demon.”</p>\n\n<p>“I was on the edge of my seat most of the time because I was caught up in the rush of the ride,” he recalls. Although the 12-hour shifts were grueling, he never drank coffee or took drugs.</p>\n\n<p>“It was all the adrenalin that flowed from my driving style. I enjoyed the thrill of driving and the sense of competitiveness. Some people really loved it; others were scared and wanted out so I would have to drop them off. Once in a while I would have a passenger that really enjoyed it. One guy jumped out of the cab and said, ‘My God, that was a religious experience!’”</p></blockquote>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/NYC\">NYC</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/photography\">photography</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Ryan%20Weideman\">Ryan Weideman</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/taxis\">taxis</a></p>\n\n         <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/06/riding-with-the-street-demon\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"582122c9223d35fc3e834090db8158ef4c1b077a08721acd501503c046c61804","category":"default"}
