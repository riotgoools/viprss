For the next installment of my newish illustrated column here on Kottke dot org, I talked to my friend <a href=\"https://twitter.com/catucci\">Nick Catucci</a>. Nick edits the excellent newsletter <a href=\"https://embedded.substack.com/\">Embedded</a>, which partially inspired me to start this column. (Specifically, Embedded has an interview series called <a href=\"https://embedded.substack.com/t/my-internet\">My Internet</a> that I’ve always loved.) Nick is also site director at GQ. And about 13 years ago the two of us worked at Vulture together.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Hey Nick! Have you read (watched, listened to, or otherwise experienced) anything good recently?<br />\n</strong>I think I speak for my demographic when I say that the new Waxahatchee album, <a href=\"https://www.waxahatchee.com/\">Tigers Blood</a>, is a dream. My friends at Pitchfork published a great <a href=\"https://pitchfork.com/features/cover-story/waxahatchee-tigers-blood-interview/\">profile</a> of Katie by Andy Cush where she’s really insightful about how, being sober, she’s drawing from a different well than heroes of hers like Townes Van Zandt and Jason Molina. (One of the neat things about the album is that the harmonies with MJ Lenderman, her new collaborator, sort of dramatize this tension.)</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/nicktigersblood.jpg\" srcset=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=500,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/nicktigersblood.jpg 500w, /cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/nicktigersblood.jpg 1200w\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1075\" height=\"1034\" alt=\"nicktigersblood.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>There’s one other thing that gives me serenity the way that Waxahatchee does right now, and that is this <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@dk_dreamhouse\">couple on TikTok</a> who are renovating a hoarder house in Washington state. I have never watched HGTV and the concept of house-flipping nauseates me, but I’ve grown so attached to the process of these two people (who do flip houses, but plan to move into this one) racing to make this once-grand place livable before their six-month loan runs out that I’m dreading the day that they’re able to refinance.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/nickdkdreamhouse.jpg\" srcset=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=500,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/nickdkdreamhouse.jpg 500w, /cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/nickdkdreamhouse.jpg 1200w\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1372\" height=\"1078\" alt=\"nickdkdreamhouse.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p><strong>Anything bad?</strong><br />\nBasically everything that goes super viral on Twitter now, like The Willy Wonka Experience and “flush ponytail.” The recycled jokes, race for interviews with random people involved, “imagine explaining this to someone who isn’t chronically online”—the whole cycle seems more childish and desperate than ever. It’s as if everyone is doing their own <a href=\"https://embedded.substack.com/p/millennial-meme-marketing-must-end\">Millennial meme marketing</a> of themselves.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What’s something you’ve read or seen that changed your life?</strong><br />\nMy wife published a memoir, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1455563315/ref=nosim/0sil8\">Down City</a>, in 2017, and reading the transcript for the first time completely opened up my perspective—on this woman that I cherish, this sometimes corrupt place where we both grew up, and love within families.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/nickdowncity.jpg\" srcset=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=500,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/nickdowncity.jpg 500w, /cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/nickdowncity.jpg 1200w\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"943\" height=\"1274\" alt=\"nickdowncity.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>Bonus answer: Two editors I was talking to about a staff writer job early in my career asked me what music changed my life, and the answer that popped into my head was Ice-T’s metal band, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_Count_(band)\">Body Count</a>, which I would play at eardrum-damaging volume on big headphones when my mother would drive me to middle school. One of my older brothers owned an early cassette version of their first album, when it still included “Cop Killer.” The editors found that response really funny. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you subscribe to anything you don’t read? (Or otherwise consume?)</strong><br />\nI’m sure that there are nice little communities in the Discords that some newsletters host for subscribers, but I can’t imagine ever logging on to any of them. Separately, I resent that my costly subscription to The New York Times is justified in part by games that I don’t play.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Read anything you don’t subscribe to?</strong><br />\nTechnically I have access to everything I read in Apple News and the publishers see some revenue for that, but clicking on “The truth about weed and your brain” and “She’s a sociopath. Here’s what she wishes people knew” is not the same as subscribing to National Geographic or The Wall Street Journal.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/nicksociopath.jpg\" srcset=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=500,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/nicksociopath.jpg 500w, /cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/nicksociopath.jpg 1200w\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"333\" alt=\"nicksociopath.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p><strong>What’s something you’ve lied about reading or watching? Or felt tempted to lie about?</strong><br />\nI don’t lie. I just allow my friends to think that I must have read their books or listened to their podcasts (which of course I sometimes do, so they can never be sure).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Does anything make you laugh online?</strong><br />\nAll the time. The For You page was a tremendous innovation for people like me who are powerless not to engage with stupid content. TikTok serves me lots of <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@grantegibbs/video/7351166555922779434\">very</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@barrontrump2006/video/7338813927112936725\">funny</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@kay_wow/video/7333651016438598958\">videos</a>, and I agreed, as I usually do, with my worldly and straight-shooting <a href=\"https://www.gq.com/newsletter/subscribe?newsletterId=249016\">columnist</a> Chris Black when he <a href=\"https://www.gq.com/story/pulling-weeds-chris-black-twitter-is-better-than-ever\">wrote</a> in July 2023 that the introduction of Twitter’s For You feed “polarized my timeline but has consistently exposed me to some of the most hilarious stuff I have seen on the app in years.”</p>\n\n<p><strong>Are there any cultural moments you currently think about unusually often? Like are you haunted by a moment from a TV show, or anything like that?</strong><br />\nI may be taking “haunted” too literally, but I do think about the Richard Ford <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/series/END/bascombe-trilogy/\">protagonist</a> Frank Bascombe, who, in my view, makes a valiant effort to truly live after the death of his young son. I wonder if his life is tragic, or a triumph. (Please don’t email me if you wrote a graduate thesis about this and know the answer.)</p>\n\n<p><strong>What were you really into when you were 12?</strong><br />\nI turned 12 in 1991, and at that time, my older brother owned an 18-plus dance club in Providence, RI. He booked DJs like Kid Capri and live shows with painfully early-‘90s rap acts like Das EFX and Fu-Schnickens, and I would sometimes serve sodas at the bar. I witnessed 800 kids pogoing to “The Choice Is Yours (Revisited)” when Black Sheep came through around the height of that song’s popularity, and remember that on the night that Del the Funky Homosapien rolled in, the buzz was that his cousin Ice Cube was on the bus and might jump on stage with him (he was not on the bus). I got to meet most of these guys, and they were impossibly cool, floating through the club’s back rooms on clouds of blunt smoke, but also pretty nice to this nerdy kid asking for their autographs.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/nickblacksheep.jpg\" srcset=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=500,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/nickblacksheep.jpg 500w, /cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/nickblacksheep.jpg 1200w\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1077\" height=\"1083\" alt=\"nickblacksheep.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>Obviously this all left a massive imprint on my soft adolescent brain. To this day, one of my greatest style inspirations remains Grand Puba. The press photo he signed for me shows him, as I remember, immaculately turned out in a baggy striped polo shirt (Ralph Lauren or Tommy Hilfiger, presumably), dark Girbaud denim shorts, and those Timberland boat shoes with the lug soles.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/nickgrandpuba.jpg\" srcset=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=500,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/nickgrandpuba.jpg 500w, /cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/nickgrandpuba.jpg 1200w\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1113\" height=\"1388\" alt=\"nickgrandpuba.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p><strong>Is there a book/movie/whatever you wish you could experience again for the first time?</strong> <br />\nInception in the theater. I saw Fugazi play in Providence as a high schooler and would like to do that again, if possible. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Please tell me something silly that you love.</strong><br />\nSpeaking in my dog’s voice (breathless young female resistance Democrat) to threaten myself in the meanest, most violent terms possible when I do something mildly annoying around my wife.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/nickdog.jpg\" srcset=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=500,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/nickdog.jpg 500w, /cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/nickdog.jpg 1200w\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1093\" height=\"825\" alt=\"nickdog.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p><strong>Has anyone ever described you in a way you felt was really accurate?</strong><br />\nWhen I’m with my almost-five-year-old daughter and her friends at the playground or waiting for the bus, she’s sometimes tells them, “That’s my dad—he’s so funny.” And in those moments, I know that I am funny, to her.</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Previously</strong>: <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/03/drawing-media-with-jason-k\">Jason Kottke</a>, <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/04/drawing-media-an-interview-with-jim-behrle\">Jim Behrle</a></em></p>\n\n <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Drawing%20Media\">Drawing Media</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/interviews\">interviews</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Nick%20Catucci\">Nick Catucci</a></p>\n\n <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/04/drawing-media-an-interview-with-nick-catucci\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Edith Zimmerman","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"b647e5e55f5616f436514f801c1ad444e25edfa36915d5f4eff6f8aed60cb9d5","category":"default"}
