From the synopsis:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>“These ten men were not men of distinction,” Mayer noted, but they had been members of the Nazi Party; Mayer wanted to discover what had made them Nazis. His discussions with them of Nazism, the rise of the Reich, and mass complicity with evil became the backbone of this book, an indictment of the ordinary German that is all the more powerful for its refusal to let the rest of us pretend that our moment, our society, our country are fundamentally immune.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>And from <a href=\"https://press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/511928.htm\">an excerpt of the book</a> describing how the road to fascism is like being a frog in a gradually heated pot of water:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>“But the one great shocking occasion, when tens or hundreds or thousands will join with you, never comes. <em>That’s</em> the difficulty. If the last and worst act of the whole regime had come immediately after the first and smallest, thousands, yes, millions would have been sufficiently shocked — if, let us say, the gassing of the Jews in ‘43 had come immediately after the ‘German Firm’ stickers on the windows of non-Jewish shops in ‘33. But of course this isn’t the way it happens. In between come all the hundreds of little steps, some of them imperceptible, each of them preparing you not to be shocked by the next. Step C is not so much worse than Step B, and, if you did not make a stand at Step B, why should you at Step C? And so on to Step D.</p>\n\n<p>“And one day, too late, your principles, if you were ever sensible of them, all rush in upon you. The burden of self-deception has grown too heavy, and some minor incident, in my case my little boy, hardly more than a baby, saying ‘Jewish swine,’ collapses it all at once, and you see that everything, everything, has changed and changed completely under your nose. The world you live in — your nation, your people — is not the world you were born in at all. The forms are all there, all untouched, all reassuring, the houses, the shops, the jobs, the mealtimes, the visits, the concerts, the cinema, the holidays. But the spirit, which you never noticed because you made the lifelong mistake of identifying it with the forms, is changed. Now you live in a world of hate and fear, and the people who hate and fear do not even know it themselves; when everyone is transformed, no one is transformed. Now you live in a system which rules without responsibility even to God. The system itself could not have intended this in the beginning, but in order to sustain itself it was compelled to go all the way.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>One is also reminded of Hemingway’s quote about how one goes bankrupt: “gradually and then suddenly”.

It’ll be much more subtle than that. It’ll be more of the president ignoring laws passed by congress. It’ll be more demonizing of the press.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>I found this via <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/karenattiah.bsky.social/post/3ld2et5ighs24\">Karen Attiah’s thread about personal foundational texts</a>.</p>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/books\">books</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Milton%20Mayer\">Milton Mayer</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Nazis\">Nazis</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/They%20Thought%20They%20Were%20Free\">They Thought They Were Free</a></p>\n\n         <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/12/they-thought-they-were-free\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"14594291cc839394667e7546101ca658bbcdeb4f845125cb70b2b9fb8c7e9ddb","category":"Sites"}
