If we think of large language models, should we let them feel disgust so that they avoid left-wing bias?</p>\r\n<p><strong>BLOOM: </strong>[laughs] Why would disgust make them avoid left-wing bias?</p>\r\n<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Maybe we’re not sure it would, but there are various claims in the literature that for people on the right, disgust is a more fundamental emotion, and that a greater capacity to feel disgust encourages people in some ways to be more socially conservative. Debatable, but I don’t think it’s a crazy view. So, if you build LLMs, and you give them, say, a lot of empathy and not much or any disgust, you’re going to get left-leaning LLMs, which you might say, “Well, that was my goal.” But obviously, not everyone will accept <em>that</em> conclusion either.</p>\r\n<p><strong>BLOOM: </strong>I wouldn’t want woke LLMs. I think there’s a lot in extreme —</p>\r\n<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>You’ve got them, of course.</p>\r\n<p><strong>BLOOM: </strong>I’ve got them. I think Gemini is the one, if I wanted to go — the woke LLM of choice. Because I think the doctrine called wokeness leads to a lot of moral problems and makes the world worse in certain ways, but I wouldn’t mind left-wing LLMs.</p>\r\n<p>In fact, I’m not a fan of disgust. You’re right that <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://minddevlab.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/Conservatives%20are%20more%20easily%20disgusted%20than%20liberals_%20disgust_conservatism.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">disgust is often associated with right-wing</a>, but in the very worst instantiation of it. Disgust is what drives hatred towards gay people. It involves hatred of interracial marriage, the exclusion of immigrants, the exclusion of other races. If there’s one emotion I would take away from people, it would be disgust, at least disgust in the moral realm. They could keep their disgust towards rotten food and that sort of thing. That’s the one thing I <em>wouldn’t</em> put into LLMs. I’d rather put anger, pity, gratitude. Disgust is the one thing I’d keep away.</p>\r\n<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>So, you wouldn’t just cut back on it at the margin. You would just take disgust out of people if you could?</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>And:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>I think at the margin, I’ve moved against empathy <em>more</em> being a podcast host, that I’ll ask a question —</p>\r\n<p><strong>BLOOM: </strong>Wait. Why being a podcast host?</p>\r\n<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Well, I’ll ask a question, and a lot of guests think it’s high status simply to signal empathy rather than giving a substantive answer. The signaling-empathy answers I find quite uninteresting, and I think a lot of my listeners do, too. Yet people will just keep on doing this, and I get frustrated. Then I think, “Well, Tyler, you should turn a bit more against empathy for this reason.” <em>And</em> I think that’s correct.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Paul cannot be blamed for doing that, however.  So substantive, interesting, and entertaining throughout.</p>\r\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/08/my-excellent-conversation-with-paul-bloom.html\">My excellent Conversation with Paul Bloom</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com\">Marginal REVOLUTION</a>.</p>\r\n<img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/902574827/0/marginalrevolution\" />\r\n<div><a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/902574827/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/902574827/marginalrevolution,\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/902574827/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/x.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/902574827/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/902574827/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/08/my-excellent-conversation-with-paul-bloom.html#comments\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/comments20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/08/my-excellent-conversation-with-paul-bloom.html/feed\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/commentsrss20.png\" /></a> \r\n<div><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/08/my-excellent-conversation-with-paul-bloom.html#comments\"><h3>Comments</h3></a><ul><li><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/08/my-excellent-conversation-with-paul-bloom.html#comment-160794175\">In reply to M.
