{"title":"Biden's weakness is that he didn't fire Garland","link":"http://scripting.com/2024/05/30/134935.html?title=bidensWeaknessIsThatHeDidntFireGarland","date":1717076975000,"content":"<p>I don't think the reason Biden is perceived as a failure as a president is unfair, actually. He would be a fine president if our problems were limited to the virus, the economy and climate change. He's like Obama, but with much more experience at getting things done in Washington. </p>\n<p>His failure is that the fascist movement in the country is much stronger now than it was when he took office. That's how his success or failure as a president will be measured. And he's failed that test. It's kind of recursive, in a way. </p>\n<p>But the problem could be fixed if we had this discussion out in the open, so that the press raises it every day and in every press event. They shouldn't be trying to embarrass him about his age, that's rude and deceptive. They should ask why isn't Trump in jail? All the rest of it, nowhere near as important as the answer to that question.</p>\n<p>If Biden wanted to address this, and it would certainly help his chances of winning, he would:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fire Garland immediately.</li>\n<li>Apologize for not firing him sooner. It was a mistake. My mistake. I own it. I am sorry.</li>\n<li>Nominate Jamie Raskin, Liz Cheney or Rubin Gallego as the new AG.   </li>\n<li>Biden's number one promise is that he will prosecute Trump and all insurrectionists in his second term, starting day 1. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Trump is making a fool of Biden by saying openly that he will be a dictator on Day 1.</p>\n<p>People who think Trump is losing don't get it. People are rightly fed up with Biden. But not for the economy. That's bullshit. And not because he's old. Rather because he's selling us out, just hoping against hope that the voters will save us. It's kind of unreasonable to expect that when you, the person we elected president to get us out of this hole, didn't fire the biggest obstacle to our <i>starting</i> to dig. </p>\n<p>Depend on Congress, the press, Supreme Court, now the voters. </p>\n<p>No Biden, you're the president. This is <i>your</i> job. </p>","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"595a48770d469875dd37bfdc3a1414961215e20b9ae57a4c5edaaa1239d791c5","category":"default"}
