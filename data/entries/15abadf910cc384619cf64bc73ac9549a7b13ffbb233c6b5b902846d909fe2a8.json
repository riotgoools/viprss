It was in a park that I took my first steps, had my first kiss, wondered for the first time why we are alive.</p>\n<p>The park — the proper park — as a place of contemplation, illumination, and discovery comes alive with great soulfulness in <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/We-Go-Park-Sara-Stridsberg/dp/1592704077/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>We Go to the Park</em></strong></a> (<a href=\"https://search.worldcat.org/title/1432310027\" target=\"_blank\"><em>public library</em></a>) — the product of an unusual collaboration between Swedish author and playwright Sara Stridsberg and Italian artist <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/tag/beatrice-alemagna/\">Beatrice Alemagna</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/We-Go-Park-Sara-Stridsberg/dp/1592704077/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/wegotothepark8.jpg?resize=680%2C385&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"680\" height=\"385\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/wegotothepark8.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/wegotothepark8.jpg?resize=320%2C181&amp;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/wegotothepark8.jpg?resize=600%2C340&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/wegotothepark8.jpg?resize=240%2C136&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/wegotothepark8.jpg?resize=768%2C435&amp;ssl=1 768w\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/We-Go-Park-Sara-Stridsberg/dp/1592704077/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/wegotothepark7.jpg?resize=680%2C769&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"680\" height=\"769\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/wegotothepark7.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/wegotothepark7.jpg?resize=320%2C362&amp;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/wegotothepark7.jpg?resize=600%2C679&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/wegotothepark7.jpg?resize=240%2C271&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/wegotothepark7.jpg?resize=768%2C868&amp;ssl=1 768w\" /></a></p>\n<p>At the dawn of the pandemic, amid the maddening captivity of lockdown and the tempest of uncertainty, Alemagna entered a kind of trance of painting — an outpouring of color and feeling channeling her hopes and fears, dreams and remembrances. (Every artist’s art is their coping mechanism — we make what we make to save ourselves, to stay sane, to find the slender cord of grace between us and the world.) </p>\n<p>When Stridsberg received a selection of these impressionistic unstoried images, she was moved to respond with her own art. Her spare, lyrical words gave the pictures coherence, making of them something uncommonly lovely: part story, part poem, part prayer. </p>\n<p><a

park, the collective pronoun seems to expand in widening circles as the vignettes unfurl until it becomes the voice of humanity, making the park — this “land beyond” — a miniature of our restless search for meaning, an antidote to the ordinary world where “everything is so big there’s no room for it inside of us.” </p>\n<p><a
