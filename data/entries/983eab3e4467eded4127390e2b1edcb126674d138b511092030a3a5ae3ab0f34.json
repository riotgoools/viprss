{"title":"Road Snacks #1","link":"https://kottke.org/24/03/road-snacks-1","date":1711590280000,"content":"\n        <p>Because I donâ€™t hardly blog anymore, I turned the email newsletter for my ice cream shop into kind of a blog where sure I talk about ice cream a good amount, but I also tell stories about when I was a tour manager for a band, document how terribly hostile Intuit is towards their business customer base, and share internet ephemera my customers might not have seen. Itâ€™s been feeling a little stale lately, because after three years I think I finally told all my tour stories so I wanted to do something new. </p>\n\n<p>The new thing is Road Snacks, a semi-regular feature where an ice cream shop interviews a touring musician asking questions about the food situation on tour. I think itâ€™s changed a lot and probably not too much since I was doing it. <a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/graciesicecre/love-yourself-779197?e=129c3583ca\">The first interview ran today featuring Cary Ann Hearst from the Charleston band Shovels &amp; Rope, who is great</a>.

We used to just eat pizza everyday after the show, but that will kill you eventually so we changed! Everyone watching their water and their fiber intake. Itâ€™s wild - we pop vitamins now. But in Indy the other night a man made us pizza in his shop after the show. Samâ€™s Square Pies?! The best pizza I have ever had. Detroit Style. We literally wrapped and froze individual pieces so that we wouldnâ€™t waste a slice of the 30lbs of pie - thanks Jeff!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Itâ€™s 12:30am and youâ€™re at the gas station before a five hour drive to the next city. What snacky treat(s) are you grabbing and why</strong>?</p>\n\n<p>My trash snacks from the gas station are an Arizona Green Tea in a can, pork rinds, a bag of lemon heads and pack of bubble gum. We get a gallon of water and fill our canteens. I need a mix of sweet and savory - and since we only get the opportunity to indulge those trashy snack instincts every once in a while I indulge and then remember not to do that once my blood sugar crashes.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Jason doesnâ€™t know it yet, but Iâ€™m probably gonna ask if I can run the interviews here, too. </p>\n\n <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Cary%20Ann%20Hearst\">Cary Ann Hearst</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/interviews\">interviews</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/music\">music</a></p>\n\n <p>ðŸ’¬ <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/03/road-snacks-1\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> â†’</p>\n\n    ","author":"Aaron Cohen","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"983eab3e4467eded4127390e2b1edcb126674d138b511092030a3a5ae3ab0f34","category":"default"}
