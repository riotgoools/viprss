Would I feel differently if I knew a work of art that I found inspiring was created by an AI. At first I said no, because what matters in art is how it is received, not how it was created. What effect did it have on the reviewer. That's the art. But then I remembered that when I found out that Wordle was edited by a human, that the words were chosen by a person not at random, I found the game less interesting, because certain words obviously would be eliminated from consideration, even though they are in the dictionary and are used in normal writing and speech.","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"12e368801a9be6024ab5738a2384edc4be7470d0a0235a763e6e2e9bdd9a7c3a","category":"default"}
