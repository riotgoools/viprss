This huge dam is kind of a click-baity promotion (it worked!) but the essence of the video is how beavers can help make landscapes more resilient to effects of climate change.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>Itâ€™s so big it can be seen from outer space. But thatâ€™s not the only reason NASA is interested in this architecturally minded speciesâ€¦ Increasing diversity and resilience, not to mention creating wetlands, are just some of the impacts beavers can have on their surroundings. What does this mean for the wider environment? And how can we humans learn from it?</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>See also <a href=\"https://kottke.org/21/12/unleashing-beaver-to-restore-ecosystems-and-combat-the-climate-crisis\">Unleashing Beaver to Restore Ecosystems and Combat the Climate Crisis</a>.</p>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/beavers\">beavers</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/climate%20crisis\">climate crisis</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/video\">video</a></p>\n\n         <p>ðŸ’¬ <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/04/this-beaver-dam-is-so-huge-you-can-see-it-from-space\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> â†’</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"1b235334df5a86583d784d8d6440089d2fd36d1748d49acf76da52ce8e8d729b","category":"default"}
