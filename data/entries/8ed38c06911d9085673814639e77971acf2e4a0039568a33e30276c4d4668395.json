Slop is unwanted AI-generated content.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr />\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Most AI-powered products don’t truly have product/market fit. That’s because they are easy to build (wrappers) and it’s easy to make grandiose promises on a website. Delivering value is an entirely other thing. Product marketing is far ahead of product value in most cases.  <a href=\"https://x.com/hnshah/status/1795143315643363725\">Hiten Shah</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<hr />\n\n\n\n<p>Elon Musk’s GrokAI <a href=\"https://x.ai/blog/series-b\">raised</a> $6 billion in Series B funding at $18 billion in valuation. This prompted <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40488769\">someone on</a> Hacker News to <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/WhyFromNigeria.pdf\">link to this research study</a> and thus equated Elon to Nigerian Scammers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jokes aside, it is a sign that Elon is ready to move on from “selling cars” because the Chinese (and other competition) is coming. He wants to go to “AI” and “RoboTaxis” because that’s where he sees the next growth opportunity.  </p>\n\n\n\n<hr />\n\n\n\n<p>It should come as no surprise to anyone that Facebook (nee Meta) is using dark patterns to hoodwink its users into agreeing to train its AI models on their data. Just as it did with privacy. A leopard can’t change its spots. And Meta can’t stop being Facebook. <a href=\"https://x.com/Tantacrul/status/1794863603964891567\">Twitter Thread @Tantacrul</a></p>\n\n\n\n<hr />\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“It’s inevitable. I mean, it’s like saying, ‘I don’t believe these cars are gunna work. Let’s just stick with the horses. Let’s stick with the horses.’” </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/george-lucas-thinks-artificial-intelligence-in-filmmaking-is-inevitable\">George Lucas on Generative AI in creative fields.</a> </p>\n</blockquote>","author":"Om Malik","siteTitle":"Om Malik","siteHash":"56aa7c22de1a9e5680d03082a2a13db78fe214c96b8119e8d54042cbf2d355ae","entryHash":"8ed38c06911d9085673814639e77971acf2e4a0039568a33e30276c4d4668395","category":"default"}
