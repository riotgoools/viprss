When I flipped it over, I was struck by a blurb that seemed excessive, bordering on parody. One Rick Bass said of the novel that it “is so magnificent — in every conceivable aspect, and others perviously unimagined — that it has occurred to me that the shadow of this book, and the joy I received in reading it, will fall over every other book I ever read.” It felt so hyperbolic that it put me off trusting blurbs on dust jackets forever. </p>\n\n<p>So imagine my surprise when I opened the Feb. 4 By the Book feature to see Rick Bass answer the question “What books are on your night stand?” And he replied, “‘Cold Mountain (‘re-re-re-read).”” He has restored my faith in the humble, oft-dismissed blurb in one fell swoop. It was that important to him! Lesson learned. </p>\n\n<p>Christopher Vyce<br />\nCambridge, Mass.</p></blockquote><p></p>\n\n<p>As Ruth put it: “Pure and total delight! A perfect letter!” Here’s Bass’s <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/01/books/rick-bass-sees-links-between-hunting-and-writing.html\">By the Book</a> interview, by the way. I haven’t read Cold Mountain, but I’m not sure if this makes me want to or not. I’d almost rather leave it as this legendary.</p>\n\n <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/books\">books</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Charles%20Frazier\">Charles Frazier</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Cold%20Mountain\">Cold Mountain</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Rick%20Bass\">Rick Bass</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Ruth%20Graham\">Ruth Graham</a></p>\n\n <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/03/the-majesty-of-cold-mountain\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Edith Zimmerman","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"5d9d113c68faa5c8b01a20840d7a9f5cdc7378b323266398ec7ac0f64be34f40","category":"default"}
