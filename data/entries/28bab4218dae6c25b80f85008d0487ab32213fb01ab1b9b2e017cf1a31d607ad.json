The transmutation of despair into love is what we call meaning. It is an active, searching process — a creative act. Paradoxically, we make meaning most readily, most urgently, in times of confusion and despair, when life as we know it has ceased to make sense and we must <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2024/10/22/marginalian-18/\">derive for ourselves</a> not only what makes it livable but what makes it worth living. Those are clarifying times, sanctifying times, when the simulacra of meaning we have consciously and unconsciously borrowed from our culture — God and money, the family unit and perfect teeth — fall away to reveal the naked soul of being, to hone the spirit on the mortal bone. </p>\n<p>The poetic neurologist <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/tag/oliver-sacks/\">Oliver Sacks</a> (July 9, 1933–August 30, 2015) — who thought with uncommon rigor and compassion about what it means to be human and all the different ways of being and remaining human no matter how our minds may fray — takes up this question of life’s meaning in one of his magnificent collected <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Letters-Oliver-Sacks/dp/0451492919?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>Letters</em></strong></a> (<a href=\"https://search.worldcat.org/title/1422074451\" target=\"_blank\"><em>public library</em></a>).<br />\n</p><figure><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Man-Who-Mistook-His-Wife/dp/0684853949/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/oliversacks_scourfield.jpg?resize=680%2C675&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"680\" height=\"675\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/oliversacks_scourfield.jpg?w=800&amp;ssl=1 800w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/oliversacks_scourfield.jpg?resize=240%2C238&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/oliversacks_scourfield.jpg?resize=320%2C318&amp;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/oliversacks_scourfield.jpg?resize=768%2C762&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/oliversacks_scourfield.jpg?resize=600%2C596&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/oliversacks_scourfield.jpg?resize=32%2C32&amp;ssl=1 32w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/oliversacks_scourfield.jpg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/oliversacks_scourfield.jpg?resize=64%2C64&amp;ssl=1 64w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/oliversacks_scourfield.jpg?resize=96%2C96&amp;ssl=1 96w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/oliversacks_scourfield.jpg?resize=128%2C128&amp;ssl=1 128w\" /></a><figcaption>Oliver Sacks (Photograph: Adam Scourfield)</figcaption></figure><p></p>\n<p>In his fifty-seventh year, Sacks reached out to the philosopher Hugh S. Moorhead in response to his anthology of reflections on the meaning of life by some of the twentieth century’s greatest writers and thinkers. (Three years later, <em>LIFE</em> magazine would plagiarize Moorhead’s concept in <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2012/09/17/the-meaning-of-life/\">an anthology of their own</a>, even taking the same title.) Sacks — a self-described “sort of atheist (curious, sometimes wistful, often indifferent, never militant)” — offers his own perspective:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I envy those who are able to find meanings — above all, ultimate meanings — from cultural and religious structures. And, in this sense, to “believe” and “belong.”</p>\n<p>[…]</p>\n<p>I do not find, for myself, that any steady sense of “meaning” can be provided by any cultural institution, or any religion, or any philosophy, or (what might be called) a dully “materialistic” Science. I am excited by a different vision of Science, which sees the emergence and making of order as the “center” of the universe.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It is in this 1990 letter that Sacks began germinating the seeds of the personal credo that would come abloom in his poignant deathbed reflection on <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2015/11/24/oliver-sacks-gratitude-book\">the measure of living and the dignity of dying</a> thirty-five years later. He tells Moorhead:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I do not (at least consciously) have a steady sense of life’s meaning. I keep losing it, and having to re-achieve it, again and again. I can only re-achieve (or “remember”) it when I am “inspired” by things or events or people, when I get a sense of the immense intricacy and mystery, but also the deep ordering positivity, of Nature and History. </p>\n<p>I do not believe in, never have believed in, any “transcendental” spirit above Nature; but there is a spirit in Nature, a cosmogenic spirit, which commands my respect and love; and it is this, perhaps most deeply, which serves to “explain” life, give it “meaning.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>Nine years later, in a different letter to <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/tag/stephen-jay-gould/\">Stephen Jay Gould</a>, he would take issue with the idea that there are two “magisteria” — two different realms of reality, one natural and one supernatural — writing:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Talk of “parapsychology” and astrology and ghosts and spirits infuriates me, with their implication of “another,” as-it-were parallel world. But when I read poetry, or listen to Mozart, or see selfless acts, I do, of course feel a “higher” domain (but one which Nature reaches up to, not separate in nature).</p></blockquote>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2024/09/15/what-do-you-know-girmay-fields/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/whatdoyouknow6.jpg\" /></a><figcaption>Art by Ariana Fields from <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2024/09/15/what-do-you-know-girmay-fields/\"><em>What Love Knows</em></a> by poet Aracelis Girmay</figcaption></figure>\n<p>A century and a half earlier, his beloved Darwin had articulated a similar sentiment in <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2024/05/19/darwin-messiah/\">contemplating the spirituality of nature</a> after docking the <em>Beagle</em> in Chile, as had Whitman in <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2017/12/20/walt-whitman-specimen-days-meaning-of-life/\">contemplating the meaning of life</a> in the wake of a paralytic stroke — exactly the kind of physiological and neurological disordering Sacks studied with such passion and compassion for what keeps despair at bay, what keeps life meaningful, when the mind — that meeting place of the body and the spirit — comes undone. At the heart of his letter to Moorhead is the recognition that there is something wider than thought, deeper than belief, that animates our lives:</p>\n<blockquote><p>When moods of defeat, despair, <em>accidie</em> and “So-what-ness” visit me (they are not infrequent!), I find a sense of hope and meaning in my patients, who do not give up despite devastating disease. If <em>they</em> who are so ill, so without the usual strengths and supports and hopes, if they can be affirmative — there must be something to affirm, and an inextinguishable power of affirmation within us. </p>\n<p>I think “the meaning of life” is something we have to formulate for ourselves, we have to determine what has meaning for <em>us</em>… It clearly has to do with love — what and whom and how one can love.</p></blockquote>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2022/05/12/sophie-blackall-things-to-look-forward-to/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/sophieblackall_thingstolookforwardto_Huggingafriend.jpg?resize=680%2C808&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"680\" height=\"808\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/sophieblackall_thingstolookforwardto_Huggingafriend.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/sophieblackall_thingstolookforwardto_Huggingafriend.jpg?resize=320%2C380&amp;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/sophieblackall_thingstolookforwardto_Huggingafriend.jpg?resize=600%2C713&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/sophieblackall_thingstolookforwardto_Huggingafriend.jpg?resize=240%2C285&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/sophieblackall_thingstolookforwardto_Huggingafriend.jpg?resize=768%2C912&amp;ssl=1 768w\" /></a><figcaption>Art by Sophie Blackall from <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2022/05/12/sophie-blackall-things-to-look-forward-to/\"><em>Things to Look Forward to</em></a></figcaption></figure>\n<p>As if to remind us that <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2024/08/11/loren-eiseley-love/\">the capacity for love may be the crowning achievement of consciousness, which is itself the crowning achievement of the universe, which means that we may only be here to learn how to love</a>, he adds:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I do not think that love is “just an emotion,” but that it is constitutive in our whole mental structure (and, therefore, in the development of our brains).</p></blockquote>\n<p>Complement this small fragment of Oliver Sacks’s wide and wonderful <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Letters-Oliver-Sacks/dp/0451492919?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>Letters</em></strong></a> with Rachel Carson on <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2021/06/07/rachel-carson-the-edge-of-the-sea/\">the meaning of life</a>, Loren Eiseley on <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2024/08/11/loren-eiseley-love/\">its first and final truth</a>, and Mary Shelley — having lost her mother at birth, having lost three of her own children, her only sister, and the love of her life before the end of her twenties — on <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2020/04/16/mary-shelley-the-last-man/\">what makes life worth living</a>, then revisit Oliver Sacks (writing 30 years before ChatGPT) on <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2023/05/02/oliver-sacks-making-up-the-mind/\">consciousness, AI, and our search for meaning</a> and his timely long-ago reflection on <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2023/08/05/oliver-sacks-human-scale/\">how to save humanity from itself</a>.</p>\n<hr /><h3>donating = loving</h3><p>For seventeen years, I have been spending hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars each month composing <em>The Marginalian</em> (which <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2021/10/22/brain-pickings-becoming-the-marginalian/\">bore the outgrown name <em>Brain Pickings</em></a> for its first fifteen years).
