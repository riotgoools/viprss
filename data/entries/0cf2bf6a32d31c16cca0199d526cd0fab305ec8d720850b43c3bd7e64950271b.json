At first, much of the AI generated content was bizarre, surreal images like <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/email/1cdf7620-2e2f-4450-9cd9-e041f4f0c27f/\">shrimp jesus</a>. Then, it evolved into aspirational fantasy landscapes and homes and sympathy-bait stories of impoverished children and veterans. </p><p>Now, the AI generated bait seems to be boosting a Halloween-related moral panic aimed at scaring suburban Facebook users. </p><p>\"These posts are designed specifically to be bait around Mischief Night,\" (the night before Halloween when young people get into mischief like toilet papering houses or smashing pumpkins), said Jamie Cohen, an assistant professor at CUNY Queens College who teaches media studies. </p><p>Moral panic hoaxes have always been rampant during Halloween. Decades ago it was local media that whipped parents into a frenzy over baseless fears about things like razor blades and drugs in candy, or kids pulling stunts. On Facebook, however, these types of hoaxes can bypass the media and reach tens of millions directly. This scale coupled with AI generated images lend credibility to the hoax in the minds of many viewers.</p><p>Cohen said that what concerned him about the car egging bait is that, unlike the generic AI slop before it, this one seemed to be inciting fear and distrust in people about their neighbors. </p><div><figure><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6ca7de9e-dfb4-4a75-950a-70964d306d38_2336x1150.png\"><div><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6ca7de9e-dfb4-4a75-950a-70964d306d38_2336x1150.png\" width=\"1456\" height=\"717\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6ca7de9e-dfb4-4a75-950a-70964d306d38_2336x1150.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6ca7de9e-dfb4-4a75-950a-70964d306d38_2336x1150.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6ca7de9e-dfb4-4a75-950a-70964d306d38_2336x1150.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6ca7de9e-dfb4-4a75-950a-70964d306d38_2336x1150.png 1456w\" loading=\"lazy\" /><div></div></div></a><figcaption>I love how half the eggs in all these photos are completely unbroken and balancing on the hood</figcaption></figure></div><p>\"There is this thread of anger that is going on as we're getting closer to the election,\" he said. \"[It makes you wonder], what is your neighbor doing? It's the perfect bait because it has two things at once: those damn kids, plus anger or vitriol towards your neighbor.\"</p><p>As Facebook becomes more and more overwhelmed by AI generated garbage, the content and stories told alongside it will likely become more extreme. The car egging thing is a good example of a story that seems relatively harmless, but sows outrage and promotes the hoax that these sorts of egg attacks are becoming more common. </p><p>“[The AI imagery] on Facebook is going down this evolutionary track from very basic range bait to visuals of car damage,” Cohen said. If Meta can’t figure out how to mitigate the spread of this sort of garbage, “the next trend,” he said, “is going to be stranger and more violent.”</p><div><div><div><p>User Mag is a reader-supported publication.

As she passes, she remarks, “and they were roommates!” Flipping the camera back around to himself, mattsukkar says to the camera aghast, “Oh my god, they were roommates.”</p><p>The Vine was looped nearly 70 million times and YouTube reuploads have amassed <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-P0m0M_8pc\">tens of millions of views</a>. The clip was posted again to Twitter last week on its 10th anniversary when one woman <a href=\"https://x.com/mxgbx/status/1849900215492563382\">quote tweeted the video and commented</a>, “If this came out today people would find the woman in the video an harrass her to find out who the 'roommates' were+ the story behind it. shed probably be invited on talk tuah podcast or stn.”</p><p>It turns out the woman in the video <a href=\"https://x.com/larsanthem/status/1850189167071756351\">actually did come forward via her coworker</a> on TikTok to share the backstory. Apparently the TikTok was posted in 2022 but it really popped off this week. </p><p>The comment “and they were roommates” was apparently related to a discussion the woman was having with a friend, describing how another friend of hers from college and that girl’s roommate decided to create a business together. It turned out the roommate was potentially committing fraud. When she was called out, the roommate fled the country. And they were roommates! <a href=\"https://x.com/larsanthem/status/1850189167071756351\">Now you know</a>.</p><div><div><div><p>User Mag is a reader-supported publication.
