Not some fancy media critic opinion or an editorial. A real report, taking defensiveness out of it and applying accountability.\" A regular reader of this blog will know how totally I agree with this. But oddly when I agreed with her, perhaps a little to strongly for her liking, she accused me of being a MAGA. It's so totally not true, and typical of reporters, to use an ad hominem to not have to listen to a non-journalist opinion about journalism.","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"c4ed703e1a65e3a563270661d1c33af70ef168b58c2e2501155dee5e743e3289","category":"default"}
