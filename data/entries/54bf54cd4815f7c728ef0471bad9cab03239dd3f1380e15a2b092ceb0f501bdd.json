On <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/pfbid032amw64trW4jswCVsfwhgbfgcniSyx1styAwrKifZGZd4urQhHNaqG5zyVznnntD3l?comment_id=1492038041740096\">Facebook</a>, I delete the comments and change the permissions to only allow friends to comment. <i>The journalists are wrong about ChatGPT.</i> I solve problems with it. It guides me through difficult programming situations, esp around convoluted designs like CSS and JavaScript. It knows all of it. The only times it hallucinates (and I know it's doing it btw, I'm not stupid) is when there is not enough info on the web to give an answer. It would be nice if it just said \"I don't know\" but it's early, and they haven't figured out how to do that yet. The journalists have no sense of wonder I guess, or they never thought to use it in their jobs. I can't wait for the first aha! from a journalist -- who will say this: \"Aha! Now I see what this is for and it's freaking lovely.\" But they've decided it sucks and that's that. Too bad, we're going on without them. And thanks to the good moderation tools we can keep the turd-droppers from totally screwing it up.","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"54bf54cd4815f7c728ef0471bad9cab03239dd3f1380e15a2b092ceb0f501bdd","category":"default"}
