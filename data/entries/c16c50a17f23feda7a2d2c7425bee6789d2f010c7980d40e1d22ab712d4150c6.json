The U.S. saw over 30,000 cases and approximately 58 deaths. Despite two available vaccines there was not nearly enough supply to vaccinate even the high-risk populations. Fortunately, health authorities adopted vaccination strategies my colleagues and I had recommended for COVID such as <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com/?s=first+doses+first\">first doses first</a> and <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com/?s=fractional+dosing\">fractional dosing</a>. For example, several small studies (e.g. <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X15008762\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMc2306239\">here</a>) <span>suggested that 1/5 doses delivered intradermally could be effective and th</span><span>e FDA, EMA, and the UK all recommended this fractional dosing strategy. As result, the US was able to vaccinate around 800,000 people and the epidemic ended (natural immunity and other preventive measures also played a role).</span></p>\r\n<p>Unfortunately, a new Mpox variant is now spreading in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and nearby countries. Here’s the crazy part: despite declaring Mpox a public health emergency on August 14, the WHO has not approved any Mpox vaccines. You might think, “Who cares what the WHO authorizes?” After all, the FDA, EMA, and the UK have all granted emergency approval. But here’s the catch: the WHO’s approval is crucial for GAVI, the vaccine alliance that donates vaccines to developing countries. Without WHO approval, GAVI is reluctant to provide vaccines to the Congo. To add insult to injury, the Congo itself has approved the Jynneos and LC16 vaccines. Yet, the WHO refuses to authorize and GAVI to donate these vaccines, citing vague concerns about safety and efficacy.</p>\r\n<p>Stephanie Nolen at the NYTimes has a <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/23/health/mpox-vaccines-who-africa.html\">very good piece</a> on this mess:</p>\r\n<blockquote><p>Three years after the last worldwide mpox outbreak, the W.H.O. still has neither officially approved the vaccines — although the United States and Europe have — nor has it issued an emergency use license that would speed access.</p>\r\n<p>One of these two approvals is necessary for UNICEF and Gavi, the organization that helps facilitate immunizations in developing nations, to buy and distribute mpox vaccines in low-income countries like Congo.</p>\r\n<p>While high-income nations rely on their own drug regulators, such as the Food and Drug Administration in the United States, many low- and middle-income countries depend on the W.H.O. to judge what vaccines and treatments are safe and effective, a process called prequalification.</p>\r\n<p>But the organization is painfully risk-averse, concerned with a need to protect its trustworthiness and ill-prepared to act swiftly in emergencies, said Blair Hanewall…</p></blockquote>\r\n<p>In addition, no one has followed the other practice my colleagues and I recommended for COVID (which Operation Warp Speed did), namely advance market commitments. <span>So the vaccine manufacturers have basically been twiddling their thumbs and not gearing up for greater production. </span>(The Congo can also be faulted for not buying more on their own account.)</p>\r\n<p>All of this means that when the WHO does authorize and the vaccines begin to flow, we will still desperately need strategies like fractional dosing.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Hat tip</strong>: Ben H. and special thanks to Witold Wiecek.</p>\r\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/08/mpox-vaccines-stuck-in-limbo-who-is-at-fault.html\">Mpox Vaccines Stuck in Limbo: WHO is at Fault</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com\">Marginal REVOLUTION</a>.</p>\r\n<img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/903754424/0/marginalrevolution\" />\r\n<div><a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/903754424/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/903754424/marginalrevolution,\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/903754424/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/x.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/903754424/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/903754424/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/08/mpox-vaccines-stuck-in-limbo-who-is-at-fault.html#comments\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/comments20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/08/mpox-vaccines-stuck-in-limbo-who-is-at-fault.html/feed\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/commentsrss20.png\" /></a> \r\n<div><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/08/mpox-vaccines-stuck-in-limbo-who-is-at-fault.html#comments\"><h3>Comments</h3></a><ul><li><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/08/mpox-vaccines-stuck-in-limbo-who-is-at-fault.html#comment-160806193\">In reply to Tom T..
