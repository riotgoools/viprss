Itâ€™s November and Marianne is having a wisdom tooth removed. Connell is driving her to the clinic because heâ€™s her only friend with a car, and also the only person in whom she confides about distasteful medical conditions like impacted teeth. He sometimes drives her to the doctorâ€™s office when she needs antibiotics for urinary tract infections, which is often. They are twenty-three.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>And that Rooney also published <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0571351956/ref=nosim/0sil8\">a novella called Mr Salary</a> in 2019.</p>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/books\">books</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Mr%20Salary\">Mr Salary</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Normal%20People\">Normal People</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Sally%20Rooney\">Sally Rooney</a></p>\n\n         <p>ðŸ’¬ <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/10/two-sally-rooney-things-i-didnt-know-about\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> â†’</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"1ea74f851fc73e18c8894ec5cff91733ec55a0e850c16af5662e4d4d82e89db6","category":"Sites"}
