{"title":"The Generalist interviews me","link":"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/896907986/0/marginalrevolution~The-Generalist-interviews-me.html","date":1716095099000,"content":"<p>I was happy with <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://thegeneralist.substack.com/p/tyler-cowen\" target=\"_blank\">how this turned out</a>, here is one excerpt:</p>\r\n<blockquote><p>I think we’re overestimating the risks to American democracy. The intellectual class is way too pessimistic. They’re not used to it being rough and tumble, but it’s been that way for most of the country’s history. It’s correct to think that’s unpleasant. But by being polarized and shouting at each other, we actually resolve things and eventually move forward. Not always the right way. I don’t always like the decisions it makes. But I think American democracy is going to be fine.</p>\r\n<p>Polarization has its benefits. In most cases, you say what you think, and sooner or later, someone wins. Abortion is very polarized, for example. I’m not saying which side you should think is correct, but states are re-examining it. Kansas recently voted to allow abortion, and Arizona is in the midst of a debate. Over time, it will be settled—one way or another. Slugging things out is underrated.</p>\r\n<p>Meanwhile, being reasonable with your constituents is overrated. Look at Germany, which has non-ideological, non-polarized politics. They’ve gotten every decision wrong. Their whole strategy of buying cheap energy from Russia to sell to China was a huge blunder. They bet most of their economy on it, and neither of those two things will work out. They also have no military whatsoever. It’s not like, “Ok, they don’t spend enough.” They literally had troops that didn’t have rifles to train with and were forced to use broomsticks.</p>\r\n<p>Germany is truly screwed and won’t face up to it. But when you listen to their politicians speak – and I do understand German – they always sound intelligent and reasonable. They could use a dose of polarization, but they’re afraid because of their history, which I get. But the more you look at their politics, the more you end up liking ours, I would say.</p></blockquote>\r\n<p>I would note that Germany’s various “centrist” or “coalition of the middle” regimes have brought us AfD, which is polarizing in the worst way and considered to be an extremist party worthy of being spied upon.</p>\r\n<p>And this:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<h2>What craft are you spending a lifetime honing?</h2>\r\n<p>Shooting a basketball. I’ve done that for the longest, outside of eating and breathing. I’m just not very good at it.</p>\r\n<p>I started doing it when I was about eight. We moved close to a house with a hoop, and all the other kids would gather there and play. It was a social thing, and I started doing it. I kept it going in all the different places I’ve lived. The only country I couldn’t keep the habit going was Germany. But when I was living in New Zealand, I made a special point of it. It’s good exercise, it’s relaxing, you get to be outside. It’s a little cold today, but I did it yesterday, and I’ll do it tomorrow.</p>\r\n<p>It’s important to repeatedly do something you’re not that good at. Most successful people are good at what they do, but if that’s <em>all</em> they do, they lose humility. They find it harder to understand a big chunk of the world that doesn’t have their talent or is simply mediocre. It helps you keep things in perspective.</p>\r\n<p>I’m not <em>terrible</em> at it. I have gotten better, even recently. But no one would say I’m really good.</p></blockquote>\r\n<p>Interesting throughout, as they like to say.</p>\r\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/05/the-generalist-interviews-me.html\">The Generalist interviews me</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com\">Marginal REVOLUTION</a>.</p>\r\n<img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/896907986/0/marginalrevolution\" />\r\n<div><a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/896907986/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/896907986/marginalrevolution,\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/896907986/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/x.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/896907986/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/896907986/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/05/the-generalist-interviews-me.html#comments\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/comments20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/05/the-generalist-interviews-me.html/feed\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/commentsrss20.png\" /></a> \r\n<div><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/05/the-generalist-interviews-me.html#comments\"><h3>Comments</h3></a><ul><li><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/05/the-generalist-interviews-me.html#comment-160759172\">In reply to Gorgasal.
