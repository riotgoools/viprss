Nested midway through his allegorical adventure tale of rabbits is Adams’s serenade to moonlight:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The full moon, well risen in a cloudless eastern sky, covered the high solitude with its light. We are not conscious of daylight as that which displaces darkness. Daylight, even when the sun is clear of clouds, seems to us simply the natural condition of the earth and air… We take daylight for granted. But moonlight is another matter. It is inconstant. The full moon wanes and returns again. Clouds may obscure it to an extent to which they cannot obscure daylight.</p></blockquote>\n<figure><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/winter-moon-at-toyamagahara-by-hasui-kawase-1931_print?sku=s6-19564919p4a1v46?curator=brainpicker\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/hasuikawase3.jpg?resize=680%2C1005&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"680\" height=\"1005\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/hasuikawase3.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/hasuikawase3.jpg?resize=320%2C473&amp;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/hasuikawase3.jpg?resize=600%2C887&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/hasuikawase3.jpg?resize=240%2C355&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/hasuikawase3.jpg?resize=768%2C1135&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/hasuikawase3.jpg?resize=1039%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 1039w\" /></a><figcaption><em>Winter Moon at Toyamagahara</em> by <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2021/03/22/hasui-kawase-prints/\">Hasui Kawase</a>, 1931.

Lewis captured in asserting that <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2014/09/08/c-s-lewis-four-loves-friendship/\">“friendship is unnecessary, like philosophy, like art, like the universe itself [and] has no survival value; rather it is one of those things which give value to survival.”</a> </p>\n<p>A century after Walt Whitman exulted that the Moon <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2023/11/08/albert-pinkham-ryder/\">“commends herself to the matter-of-fact people by her usefulness, and makes her uselessness adored by poets, artists, and all lovers in all lands,”</a> Adams writes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Water is necessary to us, but a waterfall is not. Where it is to be found it is something extra, a beautiful ornament. We need daylight and to that extent it is utilitarian, but moonlight we do not need. When it comes, it serves no necessity. It transforms. It falls upon the banks and the grass, separating one long blade from another; turning a drift of brown, frosted leaves from a single heap to innumerable flashing fragments; or glimmering lengthways along wet twigs as though light itself were ductile. Its long beams pour, white and sharp, between the trunks of trees, their clarity fading as they recede into the powdery, misty distance of beech woods at night. In moonlight, two acres of coarse bent grass, undulant and ankle deep, tumbled and rough as a horse’s mane, appear like a bay of waves, all shadowy troughs and hollows. The growth is so thick and matted that even the wind does not move it, but it is the moonlight that seems to confer stillness upon it. We do not take moonlight for granted. It is like snow, or like the dew on a July morning. It does not reveal but changes what it covers.</p></blockquote>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2023/11/08/albert-pinkham-ryder/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Ryder_Siegfried.jpg?resize=680%2C658&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"680\" height=\"658\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Ryder_Siegfried.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Ryder_Siegfried.jpg?resize=320%2C310&amp;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Ryder_Siegfried.jpg?resize=600%2C581&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Ryder_Siegfried.jpg?resize=240%2C232&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Ryder_Siegfried.jpg?resize=768%2C743&amp;ssl=1 768w\" /></a><figcaption><em>Siegfried and the Rhine Maidens</em> by <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2023/11/08/albert-pinkham-ryder/\">Albert Pinkham Ryder</a>, 1888/1891.

In a splendid counterpart to Paul Goodman’s <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2015/01/13/paul-goodman-silence/\">spiritual taxonomy of silence</a>, Huxley offers a spiritual taxonomy of moonlight: </p>\n<blockquote><p>The moon is a stone; but it is a highly numinous stone. Or, to be more precise, it is a stone about which and because of which men and women have numinous feelings. Thus, there is a soft moonlight that can give us the peace that passes understanding. There is a moonlight that inspires a kind of awe. There is a cold and austere moonlight that tells the soul of its loneliness and desperate isolation, its insignificance or its uncleanness. There is an amorous moonlight prompting to love — to love not only for an individual but sometimes even for the whole universe.</p></blockquote>\n<figure><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/17th-century-astronomical-art-by-maria-clara-eimmart-moon-phases_print?curator=brainpicker\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/mariaclaraeimmart_moon4.jpg?resize=680%2C451&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"680\" height=\"451\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/mariaclaraeimmart_moon4.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/mariaclaraeimmart_moon4.jpg?resize=240%2C159&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/mariaclaraeimmart_moon4.jpg?resize=320%2C212&amp;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/mariaclaraeimmart_moon4.jpg?resize=768%2C509&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/mariaclaraeimmart_moon4.jpg?resize=600%2C398&amp;ssl=1 600w\" /></a><figcaption>Phases of the Moon by the self-taught 17th-century artist and astronomer <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2019/01/06/maria-clara-eimmart/\">Maria Clara Eimmart</a>.
