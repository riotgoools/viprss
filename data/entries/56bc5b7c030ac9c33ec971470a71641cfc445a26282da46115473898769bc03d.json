I did eight podcasts that month. The mail list, which Adam started, was going strong. This is the month where <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2013/04/07/howPodcastingGotItsName.html\">podcasting got its name</a>, thanks to some brilliant creativity from Dannie Gregoire. Until then we were calling them \"audio blog posts\" or some variant thereof. You can see it in this <a href=\"https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;q=podcast\">Google Trends</a> graph. I started a <a href=\"http://scripting.com/podcast0/rss.xml\">special feed</a> to echo my programs from 2004, I even got it registered in <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/dws-podcast0-feed/id1752527298\">Apple's podcast</a> database.  There will be two podcasts in the feed today because I missed the one from yesterday. <i>Still diggin!</i>","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"56bc5b7c030ac9c33ec971470a71641cfc445a26282da46115473898769bc03d","category":"Sites"}
