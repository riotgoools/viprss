Joe Rogan*, Adin Ross, the Nelk Boys, and the myriad content creators who Trump collaborated with during his campaign played a key role in amplifying conservative messaging and helping him reach audiences that traditional right-wing outlets simply never could. You can read more about Trump's influencer strategy in <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/politics-news/trump-wins-influencer-election-1236055439/\">an article I wrote for </a><em><a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/politics-news/trump-wins-influencer-election-1236055439/\">The Hollywood Reporter</a></em><a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/politics-news/trump-wins-influencer-election-1236055439/\"> today</a>. </p><p>While the right has spent years fostering a symbiotic relationship with alternative media, the left has failed replicate anything like it. There are simply no progressive content creators with Rogan's cultural impact and online following, and a quick look at the podcast charts or trending channels on YouTube shows the disparity between conservative vs progressive creators' reach online.</p><p>Without a network of culturally relevant influential content creators boosting and translating their messaging, the Democratic Party is rapidly losing credibility among younger, predominantly male audiences who have become ardent supporters of influencers that promote a distinctly conservative worldview. </p><p>This imbalance when it comes to online influence is no accident. It is the result of massive structural disadvantages in funding, promotion, and institutional support. And understanding why Democrats can't (or really won't) cultivate an equivalent independent media ecosystem that rivals what the right has built is crucial for anyone who hopes to ever see the Democrats back into power. </p><div><figure><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/ElieNYC/status/1854095373783990295\"><div><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb87ed7b1-3dca-42a7-87f6-1e23c3b3857a_884x382.png\" width=\"660\" height=\"285.20361990950227\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb87ed7b1-3dca-42a7-87f6-1e23c3b3857a_884x382.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb87ed7b1-3dca-42a7-87f6-1e23c3b3857a_884x382.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb87ed7b1-3dca-42a7-87f6-1e23c3b3857a_884x382.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb87ed7b1-3dca-42a7-87f6-1e23c3b3857a_884x382.png 1456w\" /><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>The conservative media landscape in the United States is exceptionally well-funded, meticulously constructed, and highly coordinated. Wealthy donors, PACs, and corporations with a vested interest in preserving or expanding conservative policies strategically invest in right-wing media channels and up and coming content creators. </p><p>This creates a well oiled pipeline for conservative influencers: young TikTokers, YouTubers, livestreamers, or podcasters are discovered, developed, and pushed to larger platforms, often with the financial backing of conservative billionaires or organizations on the right who have long recognized the content creator industry a valuable means of shaping public opinion and policy.</p><p>Organizations like Turning Point USA, <em>PragerU</em>, and <em>The Daily Wire</em> and others receive millions from backers who view them as advertising for a broader conservative agenda. These media entities act as content creator incubators and spend extensively on outreach, production quality, and audience growth. The resources and near unlimited funds they receive allow conservative content creators to grow rapidly and spread their message widely. </p><div><div><div><p>User Mag is a 100% reader-supported publication.

Charlie Kirk, founder of Turning Point USA, receives millions from conservative mega donors including the Koch network. Right wing content creators Benny Johnson, Tim Pool and Dave Rubin were recently getting paid $400,00 a month, at least $100,000 per YouTube video, after accepting funding from a right wing Russian influence operation. Johnson even allegedly <a href=\"https://x.com/ariehkovler/status/1831413692409487766\">negotiated a $100,000 signing bonus</a>.</p><p>Renee DiResta, a researcher and author of Invisible Rulers: The People Who Turn Lies Into Reality, recently <a href=\"https://www.threads.net/@renee.diresta/post/C_glj7PStwI\">posted</a> that, if you want to amass power online, pouring money into the influencer industry is essentially cheaper than buying bots or banner ads online. \"Buying authentic influencers is a far better use of funds than creating fake personas, because they bring their own trusting audiences and are actually, you know, real,\" she posted on <a href=\"https://www.threads.net/@renee.diresta/post/C_glj7PStwI\">Threads</a>. </p><p>The conservative content creator ecosystem is also extremely collaborative. Over the past two decades, conservatives have built a flywheel of cross-pollination. Right-wing content creators frequently appear on each other's shows and lift up smaller YouTube channels, podcasters, and up-and-coming creators. This results in an extended network of voices that reaches a wide range of conservative leaning audiences. </p><p>Conservative influencers are also able to rapidly gain credibility because influential Republican figures like Trump are willing to engage with them, appear on their podcasts, speak to them for their newsletters, or guest on their livestreams. </p><p>As I wrote in September, when right wing creators began getting deplatformed more frequently on mainstream social media apps in the second half of the 2010s, an entire ecosystem of alternative platforms aimed at helping extremist influencers monetize and amass audiences, cropped up.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.usermag.co/subscribe?\"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p>Rumble, a video sharing platform similar to YouTube backed by billionaire Peter Thiel, began <a href=\"https://archive.ph/VhGoh\">paying far right influencers</a> and anti vaxx content creators hundreds of thousands of dollars to create content on its platform in 2021. Locals, a newsletter platform owned by Rumble, allows influencers to monetize through newsletters in a similar way to Substack. </p><p>DLive, a right wing Twitch competitor, allowed influencers storming the Capitol building on January 6th, to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/08/technology/dlive-capitol-mob.html\">make thousands of dollars off their live streams</a>. Kick and Cozy.tv, two other right wing live streaming platforms, permit nearly any far right extremist the ability to create content and start earning money. </p><p>And X, under Musk, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/07/13/twitter-creators-payments-right-wing/\">has paid out hundreds of thousands of dollars</a> to right wing influencer accounts.</p><p>This mirror industry of social media platforms built <em>specifically</em> to amplify right wing voices inflate metrics in order to create the appearance of broader public support and user engagement. They leverage paid amplification and algorithmic tweaks to make it seem like the right wing creators on them command a much larger audience than they actually do. This perception of widespread support further amplifies conservative content creators, building a feedback loop that leftist creators, who lack similar resources, cannot match.</p><div><figure><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8b530633-5403-4ce1-a7e4-feff36eda8ea_1600x900.jpeg\"><div><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8b530633-5403-4ce1-a7e4-feff36eda8ea_1600x900.jpeg\" width=\"1456\" height=\"819\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8b530633-5403-4ce1-a7e4-feff36eda8ea_1600x900.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8b530633-5403-4ce1-a7e4-feff36eda8ea_1600x900.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8b530633-5403-4ce1-a7e4-feff36eda8ea_1600x900.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8b530633-5403-4ce1-a7e4-feff36eda8ea_1600x900.jpeg 1456w\" loading=\"lazy\" /><div></div></div></a><figcaption>Rumble, a YouTube competitor backed by Peter Thiel, is known for inflating metrics</figcaption></figure></div><p>There is simply zero equivalent to this massive infrastructure on the left. </p><p>Leftist channels do not receive widespread financial backing from billionaires or large institutional donors, primarily because leftist content creators support policies that are completely at odds with what billionaires want. </p><p>Left leaning influencers argue for things like higher taxes on the rich, regulations on corporations, and policies that curb the power of elites.

He <a href=\"https://x.com/DropSiteNews/status/1854414840799912015\">supported populist rhetoric</a> and used to feature progressives on his show more frequently. Progressive YouTuber Kyle Kulinski appeared multiple times. Bernie Sanders and Dr. Cornel West also appeared as guests. </p><p>But when Rogan endorsed Bernie back in 2020, he and Sanders were <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-51241462\">met with swift backlash</a>. Instead of recognizing Rogan's massive reach and ability to connect with an audience that might not immediately be inclined to vote with the Democratic party, some progressive Sanders supporters called on the candidate to denounce Rogan's endorsement because the podcaster had made transphobic comments in the past.
