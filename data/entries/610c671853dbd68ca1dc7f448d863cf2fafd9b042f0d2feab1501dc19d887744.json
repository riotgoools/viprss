And you basically, as a physician, had to start counseling your patients from a legal perspective and not a medical perspective.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>In the film, we hear from an anonymous woman who is a volunteer driver for patients; she drives them nine hours RT to get abortion care in Illinois:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>I had on patient, a young woman of color, and she said to me, “You know, this is really crazy. I kind of feel like I’m on the new Underground Railroad.”</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>This makes me so fucking angry.
