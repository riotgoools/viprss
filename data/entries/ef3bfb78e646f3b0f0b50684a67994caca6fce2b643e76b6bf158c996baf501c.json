And while he learned about the eclipse in his one-room schoolhouse, he doesnâ€™t recall too much hoopla surrounding it.</p>\n\n<p>F VAN ALSTYNE: I donâ€™t know. We didnâ€™t think much about general things in those days like they do now. Or we thought about minding their own business, I guess.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>(thx, caroline)</p>\n\n <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/astronomy\">astronomy</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/fashion\">fashion</a></p>\n\n <p>ðŸ’¬ <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/04/vintage-eclipse-glasses-from-the-1932-eclipse\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> â†’</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"ef3bfb78e646f3b0f0b50684a67994caca6fce2b643e76b6bf158c996baf501c","category":"default"}
