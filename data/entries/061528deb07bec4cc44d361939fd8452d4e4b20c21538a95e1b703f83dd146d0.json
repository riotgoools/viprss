The piece is written by science writer Nadia Drake — the daughter of Frank Drake, who designed the message — and it digs into the details of how the whole thing came about.</p>\n\n<p>I’ve somehow never read about <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arecibo_message\">the Arecibo message</a> before. It was sent out from the Arecibo Telescope in Puerto Rico on November 16, 1974 towards global cluster M13. The message was in binary and when properly decoded upon receipt, should look like this:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/arecibo-message-01.jpg\" srcset=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=500,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/arecibo-message-01.jpg 500w, /cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/arecibo-message-01.jpg 1200w\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1300\" height=\"929\" alt=\"what the decoded Arecibo message looks like\" /></p>\n\n<p>The drawing on the right is Frank Drake’s recently discovered first draft of the message.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>Dad targeted a globular cluster of stars called Messier 13 (M13), or the Great Cluster in the constellation of Hercules, because it would conveniently be overhead at the time of the ceremony (nestled in a sinkhole, Arecibo’s giant dish was not fully steerable). In about 25,000 years, Dad’s message will reach M13 — or at least part of it, because the majority of the cluster’s thousands of stars will have moved out of the telescope’s beam by then. But anyone who’s around to detect the Arecibo transmission, and who figures out how to decode it, will have a blueprint telling them a lot about us: what we look like, which chemical elements and biomolecules make up our DNA, what our planetary system is and how many of us existed in 1974. Dad’s transmission concluded with a binary encoded representation of the Arecibo dish itself.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-arecibo-message-earths-first-interstellar-transmission-turns-50/\">Read the whole thing</a>…it’s fascinating.</p>\n\n<p>Btw, in addition to creating the Arecibo message, Frank Drake also designed <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_equation\">the Drake equation</a> (“a probabilistic argument used to estimate the number of active, communicative extraterrestrial civilizations in the Milky Way Galaxy”), helped design the Pioneer plaque and the Voyager Golden Record, and generally kickstarted the whole SETI effort.
