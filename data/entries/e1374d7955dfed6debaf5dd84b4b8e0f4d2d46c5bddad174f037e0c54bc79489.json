I know there‚Äôs a loooot going on these days, particularly in these United States, but I wanted to take a moment to thank everyone who has supported kottke.org over the years <a href=\"https://kottke.org/members/\">with a paying membership</a>. It‚Äôs the 8th anniversary of the membership program, and I‚Äôve <a href=\"https://kottke.org/21/11/its-membership-time\">written</a> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/23/03/kottke-25-its-membership-time\">many</a> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/20/10/what-do-i-need-to-do-to-get-you-into-a-membership-today\">times</a> about what that support means to me and to the site; here‚Äôs a snippet:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>Perhaps nearest and dearest to my heart, member support keeps the site free, open, and available to everyone on an internet that is increasingly paywalled. It‚Äôs not difficult to imagine an alt-universe kottke.org with ads crammed into every bit of whitespace, email collection forms popping up on every visit, and half the site behind a members-only paywall. No shade to those who have gone that route to keep things running ‚Äî I‚Äôd probably make more money with members-only content on Substack or whatever and that pull is tempting. But seriously, I love you folks so much for collectively keeping all of kottke.org on the open web. Thank you.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>One important aspect of the open web I haven‚Äôt covered here is linking. The web has always been made up of nodes (web sites/pages) and connections between those nodes (hyperlinks). Over time, the number of nodes has increased (good!) but the nodes have also gotten larger (think Facebook or Google or even Substack) and when they get too massive and too competitive with each other with huge content moats to guard, they turn into hypertext black holes: links go in but they don‚Äôt link out.</p>\n\n<p>I <em>love</em> linking out to other sites. The strength of the open web is in its many connections between nodes‚Ä¶the more, the better. Links are the whole goddamned point of the web! I want to send people away from kottke.org to learn something new or have a chuckle and then come back the next day for more. The goal is connection, knowledge, and sharing ‚Äî <a href=\"https://waxy.org/\">I</a> <a href=\"https://thekidshouldseethis.com/\">proudly</a> <a href=\"https://www.thingsmagazine.net/\">have</a> <a href=\"https://themorningnews.org/\">no</a> <a href=\"https://www.openculture.com/\">competitors</a> <a href=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/\">in</a> <a href=\"https://www.damninteresting.com/\">this</a> <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/\">endeavor</a>, <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/\">only</a> <a href=\"https://austinkleon.com/\">collaborators</a>.

(Or if you‚Äôre a past member, to consider rejoining.) As always, if you can‚Äôt swing it, no sweat! But if you find value in this site and can manage it, <a href=\"https://kottke.org/members/\">I‚Äôd appreciate you supporting the site with a membership</a>.</p>\n\n<p>P.S. I also fixed a couple of nasty bugs with the membership system. <a href=\"mailto:jason@kottke.org?subject=kottke.org%20feedback\">Please let me know</a> if you notice anything amiss?</p>\n\n<p>P.P.S. I haven‚Äôt raised the prices on memberships in 8 years, but if you are a current member and would like to contribute more, you can <a href=\"https://kottke.memberful.com/account/subscriptions\">go to the subscriptions view</a> and click on ‚Äúchange price‚Äù.
