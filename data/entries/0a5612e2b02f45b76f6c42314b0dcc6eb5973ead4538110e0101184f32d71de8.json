Farmworkers have so far avoided tragedy, as the virus has not yet acquired the genetic tools to spread among humans. But seasonal flu will vastly increase the chances of that outcome. As the colder weather drives us all indoors to our poorly ventilated houses and workplaces, we will be undertaking an extraordinary gamble that the nation is in no way prepared for.</p>\r\n<p>All that would be more than bad enough, but we face these threats gravely hobbled by the Biden administration’s failure — one might even say refusal — to respond adequately to this disease or to prepare us for viral outbreaks that may follow.</p>\r\n<p>…Devastating influenza pandemics arise throughout the ages because the virus is always looking for a way in, shape shifting to jump among species in ever novel forms. Flu viruses have a special trick: If two different types infect the same host — a farmworker with regular flu who also gets H5N1 from a cow — they can swap whole segments of their RNA, potentially creating an entirely new and deadly virus that has the ability to spread among humans. It’s likely that the 1918 influenza pandemic, for example, started as a flu virus of avian origin that passed through a pig in eastern Kansas. From there it likely infected its first human victim before circling the globe on a deadly journey that killed more people than World War I.</p>\r\n<p>And that’s why it’s such a tragedy that the Biden administration didn’t — or couldn’t — do everything necessary to snuff out the U.S. dairy cattle infection when the outbreak was smaller and easier to address.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Will there be a large outbreak among humans? Probably not. But a <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://manifold.markets/AlexanderLeCampbell/will-there-be-a-1m-bird-flu-outbrea\">9% probabability</a> of a bad event warrants more than a shrug. Bad doesn’t have to be on the scale of COVID-bad to warrant precaution. The 2009 H1N1 flu pandemic, while relatively mild, infected about <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/52/suppl_1/S75/499147\">61 million people in the U.S.</a>, leading to 274,000 hospitalizations, 12,400 deaths, and billions of dollars in economic costs.</p>\r\n<p>H5N1 will likely pass us over—but only the weak rely on luck. Strong civilizations don’t pray for mercy from microbes; <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/starship-troopers-shoot.gif\">they crush them</a>.
