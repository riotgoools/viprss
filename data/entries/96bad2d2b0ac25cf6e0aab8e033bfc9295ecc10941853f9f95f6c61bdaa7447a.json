How would you model that as a claim about you?</p>\r\n<p><strong>NIELSEN: </strong>I hope I’m in the first 5 percent of my life, but it’s sadly unlikely.</p>\r\n<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Let’s say you’re 50 now, and you live to 100, which is plausible —</p>\r\n<p><strong>NIELSEN: </strong>Which is plausible.</p>\r\n<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>— and you would now be in the second half of your life.</p>\r\n<p><strong>NIELSEN: </strong>Yes. I can give shallow reasons. I can’t give good reasons. The good reason in the first half was, so much of the work I was doing was kind of new fields of science, and those tend to be dominated essentially, for almost sunk-cost reasons — people who don’t have any sunk costs tend to be younger. They go into these fields. These early days of quantum computing, early days of open science — they were dominated by people in their 20s. Then they’d go off and become faculty members. They’d be the youngest person on the faculty.</p>\r\n<p>Now, maybe it’s just because I found San Francisco, and it’s such an interesting cultural institution or achievement of civilization. We’ve got this amplifier for 25-year-olds that lets them make dreams in the world. That’s, for me, anyway, for a person with my personality, very attractive for many of the same reasons.</p>\r\n<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Let’s say you had a theory of your collaborators, and other than, yes, they’re smart; they work hard; but trying to pin down in as few dimensions as possible, who’s likely to become a collaborator of yours after taking into account the obvious? What’s your theory of your own collaborators?</p>\r\n<p><strong>NIELSEN: </strong>They’re all extremely open to experience. They’re all extremely curious. They’re all extremely parasocial. They’re all extremely ambitious. They’re all extremely imaginative.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Self-recommending throughout.</p>\r\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/05/my-conversation-with-the-excellent-michael-nielsen.html\">My Conversation with the excellent Michael Nielsen</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com\">Marginal REVOLUTION</a>.</p>\r\n<img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/897985697/0/marginalrevolution\" />\r\n<div><a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/897985697/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/897985697/marginalrevolution,\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/897985697/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/x.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/897985697/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/897985697/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/05/my-conversation-with-the-excellent-michael-nielsen.html#comments\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/comments20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/05/my-conversation-with-the-excellent-michael-nielsen.html/feed\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/commentsrss20.png\" /></a> \r\n<div><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/05/my-conversation-with-the-excellent-michael-nielsen.html#comments\"><h3>Comments</h3></a><ul><li><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/05/my-conversation-with-the-excellent-michael-nielsen.html#comment-160763763\">I know only a fraction of what Mr. Nielsen knows about quantum, ...</a> <i>by Jeremiah</i></li><li><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/05/my-conversation-with-the-excellent-michael-nielsen.html#comment-160763218\">In reply to Todd K.
