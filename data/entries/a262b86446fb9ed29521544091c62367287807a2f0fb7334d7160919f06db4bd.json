{"title":"Paris Waiters Race Run for the First Time in 13 Years","link":"https://kottke.org/24/03/paris-waiters-race-run-for-the-first-time-in-13-years","date":1711504043000,"content":"\n        <p>There was a race in Paris where waiters from all the restaurants and cafes and hotels rush through the streets carrying trays with water, croissants, and empty cups of coffee. The race started around 1914, but then it stopped for the last 13 years and <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/paris-olympics-food-drink-waiters-france-969ab5ae581716bf32d794ff9cf80bf0\">now they’re doing it again because of the Olympics next year</a>. The runners can switch hands, but they can’t carry the tray with two hands, and if their glass has less than 10cm of water when they finish, they get 30 seconds added to their finish time. Congratulations to this year’s winners, Pauline Van Wymeersch and Samy Lamrous. At the end of the race the guy said, “You’re finished!” And the winners said, “No, we’re French.”</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/France\">France</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/marathons\">marathons</a></p>\n\n <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/03/paris-waiters-race-run-for-the-first-time-in-13-years\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Aaron Cohen","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"a262b86446fb9ed29521544091c62367287807a2f0fb7334d7160919f06db4bd","category":"default"}
