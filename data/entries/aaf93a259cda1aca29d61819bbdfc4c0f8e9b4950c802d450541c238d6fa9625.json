I need more!”\nBut as soon as I felt that need, no — time to quit.\nNo mints in the car since that day.\n</p><p>\nSometimes it’s something big.\nI used to have an awesome job.\nI loved it so much that I became too comfortable.\nSo <a href=\"https://sive.rs/nq\">I made myself quit</a>.\nThat made me figure out how to be a full-time musician.\n</p><p>\nTen years ago, I felt addicted to America.\nIt was my comfort zone.\nI loved it too much.\nI couldn’t imagine living anywhere else.\nSo I made myself quit.\nI haven’t lived there in ten years, and probably never will again.\nPeople often ask if I miss it.\nAny regrets?\nNot at all.\n</p><p>\nI still love everything I quit.\nBut not as much as I love all this room for change.\n</p>","author":"Derek Sivers","siteTitle":"Derek Sivers","siteHash":"4098504c0d0759e13901f29e63f7d7dbb1d972a078c6dc4560660f373da5c25e","entryHash":"aaf93a259cda1aca29d61819bbdfc4c0f8e9b4950c802d450541c238d6fa9625","category":"default"}
