Yes.</a>”\n</p><p><strong>\nThen learn JavaScript, as described in “<a href=\"https://sive.rs/learn-js\">How to learn JavaScript</a>”.\n</strong></p><p>\nIf you just want to get a job or make a website, you can ignore the curiosity about other languages.\nJust master JavaScript, and it will take you far.\n</p><p>\nBut if you still find programming fascinating, make a point of learning the basics of three or four other vastly different languages, like\n<a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/head-first-sql/9780596526849/\">SQL</a>,\n<a href=\"https://www.python.org/\">Python</a>, and\n<a href=\"https://racket-lang.org/\">Racket</a>,\nbecause something clicks once you understand a few different ways of getting the end result you want.\nYou don’t need to master them.\nJust spend a month with each, going through a couple tutorial books about it, and making something happen with it.\n</p><p>\nDefinitely read “<a href=\"https://pragprog.com/titles/tpp20/\">The Pragmatic Programmer</a>”, no matter what.\n</p>\n<hr />\n<h3>\nHow do I become a better writer?\n</h3>\n<p>\nFirst read “<a href=\"https://sive.rs/book/OnWritingWell\">On Writing Well</a>”.\n</p><p>\nThen read “<a href=\"https://sive.rs/book/MadeToStick\">Made to Stick</a>”.\n</p><p>\nWrite publicly every week.\nPost it somewhere people see it.\nSomething changes when your writing is out in the public, being seen by strangers.\nSeeing it through their eyes helps more than anything.\n</p>\n<hr />\n<h3>\nWill you read or review my book?\n</h3>\n<p>\nI don’t review books.\n</p><p>\nI only read for my own self-improvement, based on my own needs at the time, then <a href=\"https://sive.rs/book\">take notes</a> for my own reflection.\n</p>\n<hr />\n<h3>\nI’m a musician. What should I do?\n</h3>\n<p>\nRead “<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/1631494791/\">How To Make It in the New Music Business</a>” by Ari Herstand, and do what he says.\n</p><p><strong>\nThis is the single best book on the current music business.\nAn absolute must-read for every musician.\n</strong></p>\n<hr />\n<h3>\nBlah blah blah blah CD Baby?\n</h3>\n<p>\n<a href=\"https://sive.rs/done\">\nI left CD Baby in 2008.\n</a>\nI haven’t talked with anyone there since then.\nI don’t even know who works there anymore.\n</p><p>\nI know nothing about what they’re doing.\nSo I have no insights and no opinions.\n</p>\n<hr />\n<h3>\nWhat should I do about my relationship, or lack of?\n</h3>\n<p>\nRead “<a href=\"https://markmanson.net/books/models\">Models</a>” by Mark Manson.\n(Only guys ask me for relationship advice.)\n</p>\n<hr />\n<h3>\nI’m really sad.\n</h3>\n<p>\nRead “<a href=\"https://sive.rs/book/WhenThingsFallApart\">When Things Fall Apart</a>” by Pema Chödrön.\n</p>\n<img src=\"/images/notlost.jpg\" />","author":"Derek Sivers","siteTitle":"Derek Sivers","siteHash":"4098504c0d0759e13901f29e63f7d7dbb1d972a078c6dc4560660f373da5c25e","entryHash":"275f857f5968715dd172dd2bfdf1cf288e5cea46664b1b1d700e57d65193fe4f","category":"default"}
