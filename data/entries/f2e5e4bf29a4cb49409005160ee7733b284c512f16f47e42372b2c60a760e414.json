It invites a suspension of disbelief from the audience, creators often play multiple characters, rapidly switching between roles with nothing more than a change in voice, facial expression, or camera angle. And importantly, it’s funny. When the whole feed is taken together, it’s almost digital vaudeville: a song, a short sketch, a physical feat, slapstick, animal acts and satire, one after another, in a personalized variety show on your phone.</p></blockquote>\r\n<p>And:</p>\r\n<blockquote><p>It’s a spectrum. At one end, we have Internet Personalities, with their cults of devotion. In the middle, we find fan culture, where some fans become prominent figures within their fandoms, stars in their own right. These <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://fanlore.org/wiki/Big_Name_Fan\">Big Name Fans</a> occasionally break out to create their own media kingdoms, as was the case with E.L. James, who authored <em>Fifty Shades of Grey</em>, itself originally <em>Twilight</em> fanfiction, and Cassandra Clare, who began in the Harry Potter fan community, before going on to write several popular fantasy series. At the other end of the spectrum are anonymous creators, whose approach to authorship is almost medieval: their projects are not about them as individuals, but the meme, the project, the aesthetic, the vision. They are less like the expressive individualists of Modern art, than the <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://jamesgrissom.blogspot.com/2013/01/ingmar-bergman-building-cathedral.html\">cathedral builders</a> of the Middle Ages.</p>\r\n<p>Much has been said about memes as art and the collective labor and imagination that goes into their creation, but it extends further than that. It’s not just memes. Creating mood boards on Pinterest or curating aesthetics on TikTok are evolving art forms, too. Constructing an atmosphere, or <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://wisdomofcrowds.live/p/truth-and-vibes?r=3321w&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web\">“vibe,”</a> through images and sounds, is itself a form of storytelling, one that’s been woefully misunderstood and <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/21/magazine/aesthetics-tiktok-teens.html\">even undermined as shallow</a>. Many of these aesthetics have staying power, like <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.vogue.com/article/coquette-aesthetic-explainer\">“coquette”</a> and <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/what-exactly-is-cottagecore\">“cottagecore.”</a> They’re not passing fads or stand-ins for personalities or subcultures. They are more than ever-evolving vectors for consumerism. They’re a type of immersive art that <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://default.blog/p/have-tiktok-aesthetics-replaced-subcultures?utm_source=publication-search\">we don’t yet have the language to fully describe</a>.</p>\r\n<p>But that is the case with so much of what’s new. We won’t understand it until it’s in the rearview mirror.</p></blockquote>\r\n<p>Interesting throughout.  Of course AI-aided creations will be the next step in this process.  Maybe you don’t like a lot of these new forms, perhaps because they do not have the nobility and grandeur of say Bach.  One simple point is that it is not optimal for every period in culture to focus on exactly what <em>you</em> want from it.  This point is rarely recognized.  Diversity across time is valuable as well!</p>\r\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/10/the-case-why-culture-is-not-stuck.html\">The case why culture is not stuck</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com\">Marginal REVOLUTION</a>.</p>\r\n<img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/905672774/0/marginalrevolution\" />\r\n<div><a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/905672774/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/905672774/marginalrevolution,\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/905672774/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/x.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/905672774/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/905672774/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/10/the-case-why-culture-is-not-stuck.html#comments\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/comments20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/10/the-case-why-culture-is-not-stuck.html/feed\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/commentsrss20.png\" /></a> \r\n<div><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/10/the-case-why-culture-is-not-stuck.html#comments\"><h3>Comments</h3></a><ul><li><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/10/the-case-why-culture-is-not-stuck.html#comment-160819518\">In reply to Anonymous.
