I was cheering out loud during the first segment. When you read this <a href=\"https://www.threads.net/@davew/post/C864lCsuwbK\">post</a>, you'll see why. I tried listening to the NYT Daily podcast today, but it made me hate them all over again, starting with saying how great a week it has been for Trump. You can say that, imho, but you have to say right after that, that it was a terrible week for the rest of us. Because any good news for Trump is awful news for everyone else. And I do mean everyone, including the people who plan to vote for him again.","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"7f27a452dc2c3aa8e5e9d733a9cfdbd1cbe79af39860e026e02dae2377410192","category":"default"}
