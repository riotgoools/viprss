Hot off its huge spike in Brazilian users, following the country’s now-reversed X ban, another big cohort moved over after Elon Musk <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/18/why-changes-to-the-block-on-elon-musks-x-are-driving-users-away/?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=nostalgia-will-not-fix-this\" target=\"_blank\">changed how blocking</a> on the platform works. In 24 hours, half a million new users <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:z72i7hdynmk6r22z27h6tvur/post/3l6pwjlt7hu2z?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=nostalgia-will-not-fix-this\" target=\"_blank\">made accounts</a> on the site, briefly taking it offline.</p><p>The block update didn’t affect me, personally, because I think I’ve only ever blocked a handful of people on Twitter. As a messy internet troll myself — and former community mod — I was always more of a fan of muting because it didn’t give people the satisfaction of knowing they had bothered me. (Yes, I am aware this is an insane way to live.)</p><p>But a different, new X update that seems to have rolled out this month has made the site pretty much unusable. My Following feed has long been a wasteland, even though I’m following almost 3,000 accounts. But now X has stickied posts from Musk at the top of the For You tab. No matter what, every time I refresh the app, regardless of the device I’m using, there will be at least two random posts from Musk sitting at the top. It seems to show you more Musk content the longer it’s been since you last refreshed.</p><div><img src=\"https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/98986e66-5589-4099-9993-990515e497d5/Screenshot_2024-10-21_at_11.03.43_AM.png?t=1729523043\" /><div><span><p>(x.com)</p></span></div></div><p>I’ve also noticed that, just in general, using X is beginning to really mess with my head. In a sense, all platforms alter your understanding of reality. Whether it’s due to insularity or algorithms. But X’s increasingly inescapable combination of autoplaying gore, white nationalism, financial scams, pornography, and endless Tesla and SpaceX updates is taking a toll. Not unlike how it felt back in the early 2010s, when I had to dig through 4chan threads after terror attacks. It wears you down after a while.</p><p>So this weekend, as I was out and about doing stuff, I tried to replace the cigarette smoker-like e-breaks I would normally fill up with X/Twitter doomscrolling by opening up Bluesky and Threads. I can confidently say Bluesky is a better replacement in that sense than Threads, which is, honestly, a truly dog shit mobile app. Though, I do find Bluesky grating for the same reason I find Portland, Oregon, kind of grating. A sort of ragged tweeness that permeates the whole place and makes it feel like a millennial retirement home. As X user @JeremiahWiggles <a href=\"https://x.com/JeremiahWiggles/status/1846998775350677652?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=nostalgia-will-not-fix-this\" target=\"_blank\">recently wrote</a>, “It does tickle me that there's a functional twitter alternative that is viable in almost every respect except for the fact that it's culture is just mid-2010s Tumblr.”</p><p>But as the more of my internet life I move over to Bluesky, the more I’m warming to it. Part of that process is learning — and appreciating — the things that make Bluesky different from Twitter (or Threads). Bluesky developer Paul Frazee wrote a <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/pfrazee.com/post/3l6xwi52zti2y?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=nostalgia-will-not-fix-this\" target=\"_blank\">fascinating thread</a> about how the site, underneath the hood, is essentially just a bundle of RSS feeds, with a few bells and whistles added to make it social. And this makes the world of Bluesky apps very exciting. For instance, here’s literally the site’s entire firehose <a href=\"https://firesky.tv/?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=nostalgia-will-not-fix-this\" target=\"_blank\">live updating</a> in real time (it eventually crashed my browser lol). I also found a <a href=\"https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/sky-follower-bridge/behhbpbpmailcnfbjagknjngnfdojpko?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=nostalgia-will-not-fix-this\" target=\"_blank\">very handy bridge</a> for migrating X follows. And both Deck Blue and Skyfeed, Tweetdeck-like interfaces for it, are far superior to Threads’ own native version. Custom feeds are also extremely useful. I particularly like the <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/bsky.app/feed/with-friends?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=nostalgia-will-not-fix-this\" target=\"_blank\">“Popular With Friends” feed</a> and “Gift Links,” which I <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/bencollins.bsky.social/post/3l6x7zok3a72s?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=nostalgia-will-not-fix-this\" target=\"_blank\">discovered recently</a> thanks to <i>The Onion</i>’s Ben Collins. </p><p>In fact, I think it’s these genuinely interesting differences between Bluesky and all the other Twitter-likes out there that the platform and its developer community need to focus on more than anything else. Every text-first platform on the web right now is running up against an internet-wide literacy wall. Unless something truly miraculous happens, it is reasonable to assume that every day there will be fewer people reading words on the internet than there were the day before. Bluesky has <a href=\"https://bsky.jazco.dev/stats?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=nostalgia-will-not-fix-this\" target=\"_blank\">around six million</a> monthly active users. Threads has <a href=\"https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/threads-now-up-150-million-monthly-active-users/714239/?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=nostalgia-will-not-fix-this\" target=\"_blank\">150 million</a> gas leak victims — though its algorithm will never let you see them all. X has <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/x-twitter-global-daily-active-users-stall-under-elon-musk?test_uuid=01iI2GpryXngy77uIpA3Y4B&amp;test_variant=a&amp;utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=nostalgia-will-not-fix-this\" target=\"_blank\">250 million</a>. But TikTok has <a href=\"https://datareportal.com/reports/digital-2024-global-overview-report?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=nostalgia-will-not-fix-this\" target=\"_blank\">over a billion</a>. We are experiencing a shift in communication as existential as climate change with ripple effects just as varied and unpredictable. But what is already very apparent is that nostalgia will not fix this. Bluesky has built a better version of what Twitter used to be, but if it wants to actually build a better version of what Twitter could be, it needs to evolve into something else entirely.</p><p>I’m sure plenty of Bluesky power users will read this and say, “Who cares. I’m happy with a tiny site that feels like a memory of how I used to use the internet.” Fair enough. But one day you’ll be the last person writing words on the web and wonder where everyone went. </p><hr /><p><i>The following is a paid ad.
