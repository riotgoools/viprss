Somewhere between the swarm behavior that takes place in applications like Waze or citizen app that collects incoming information around a specific event as it happens.</p>\n<p>There’s also the real time of perception, and how does AI in practice allow humans to perceive the environments around them starting with our own five senses senses and then other heads of data of the environment, situational awareness, etc.</p>\n<p>I came across<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03824.pdf\"> this paper</a> that  calls for embodied AI that wants to crate a foundational guideline for future E-AI research. Highlighting the importance of creating E-AI agents capable of seamless communication, collaboration, and coexistence with humans and other intelligent entities within real-world environments.. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>","author":"MDG","siteTitle":"Mark Ghuneim","siteHash":"fbdbfb355dab5247b3a3d9c04401313e99252873a1ae0fb1ea729c2e5736c6f3","entryHash":"2dedc7b9a0ee69e3708e1187f7b3e6d79678b0e56df1bde346e4e2fdd55591c1","category":"default"}
