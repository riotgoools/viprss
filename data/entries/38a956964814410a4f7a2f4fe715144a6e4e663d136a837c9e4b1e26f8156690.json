A hired CEO would have to have that explained to him. Sculley, who Graham cites, is a perfectly nice person in my experience, had no idea how to deal with Windows. Very different from a consumer product like fizzy water. Who but Steve Jobs would have thought that an iPod was a proper product for a company that made PCs. I think he himself wanted it, and that's what made something an Apple product. It's probably why post-Jobs Apple is pretty much stuck selling only the products Jobs created for them. He told <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Cook\">Cook</a> to innovate on his own vision and timetable, probably knowing full-well that nobody would be able to do it. <span>ðŸ˜„</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"38a956964814410a4f7a2f4fe715144a6e4e663d136a837c9e4b1e26f8156690","category":"Sites"}
