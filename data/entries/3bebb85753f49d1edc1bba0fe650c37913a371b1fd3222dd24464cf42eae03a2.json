I would follow it for a few days, and then abandon it again. then, a few days or weeks later, I'd do it again -- as if I were trapped on an infinite loop, trying to solve a problem that had no lasting answer. <em>(how can you try to solve an equation where the variables are always changing?)</em> obviously, the reason these systems didn't work is because it didn't account for the most crucial element of any practice: <em>change</em>. <em>flexibility</em>. <em>ongoingness</em>.</p>\n <p>a few weeks ago, I figured out a modular, tactile system that captures the spirit of how I want to move through my morning ritual. it's a system that much more accurately represents my relationship with time, practice, and process. </p><p>I can't believe it took me 9 years to make this. just like my creative immersion card deck -- a life-changing invention for me -- this is a system that's been saving me countless thought/planning loops, and grounding me deeper and deeper, instead, in lived practice. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure>\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/51e8148de4b01c1eb79c1977/28862d39-a853-4cc6-a542-d5616dbd06a8/ritual+rocks_2.jpg?format=1000w\" width=\"4032\" height=\"3024\" srcset=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/51e8148de4b01c1eb79c1977/28862d39-a853-4cc6-a542-d5616dbd06a8/ritual+rocks_2.jpg?format=100w 100w, https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/51e8148de4b01c1eb79c1977/28862d39-a853-4cc6-a542-d5616dbd06a8/ritual+rocks_2.jpg?format=300w 300w, https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/51e8148de4b01c1eb79c1977/28862d39-a853-4cc6-a542-d5616dbd06a8/ritual+rocks_2.jpg?format=500w 500w, https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/51e8148de4b01c1eb79c1977/28862d39-a853-4cc6-a542-d5616dbd06a8/ritual+rocks_2.jpg?format=750w 750w, https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/51e8148de4b01c1eb79c1977/28862d39-a853-4cc6-a542-d5616dbd06a8/ritual+rocks_2.jpg?format=1000w 1000w, https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/51e8148de4b01c1eb79c1977/28862d39-a853-4cc6-a542-d5616dbd06a8/ritual+rocks_2.jpg?format=1500w 1500w, https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/51e8148de4b01c1eb79c1977/28862d39-a853-4cc6-a542-d5616dbd06a8/ritual+rocks_2.jpg?format=2500w 2500w\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n<h1>using the morning ritual stone-dial</h1><p>I'm calling it a stone-dial, because it serves a similar function to that of a sun-dial, except that instead of moving through time, you move through each practice/processes in your ritual/routine, using stones to track your movement. it feels somewhere between a sundial and an elegant, artful game. </p>\n <p><strong>why I like this system</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>tactility</strong> - feeling the weight of stones connects me to a lived experience</li>\n<li><strong>movable/modular</strong> - I can decide to rearrange the order, add or subtract practices</li>\n<li><strong>elasticity</strong> - I don't specify that a practice takes 5\" or 30,\" which allows me to expand and contract practices according to time</li>\n<li><strong>beauty</strong> - an opportunity to experience beauty in my day</li>\n<li><strong>satisfaction</strong> - a pleasureful sense of visual accomplishment after completing my ritual</li>\n</ol>\n\n <p><strong>here are the 8 practices in my morning ritual:</strong> </p><ul>\n<li>meditation </li>\n<li>yoga/run</li>\n<li>walk luna (my dog)</li>\n<li>breakfast</li>\n<li>journaling</li>\n<li>writing</li>\n<li>visual</li>\n<li>ideas</li>\n</ul><p>the first five are practices to center and nourish myself, and the order of these practices sometimes changes (if, for example, I wake up late, or feel extremely hungry one morning).  </p><p>the last three are core creative practices that mark the beginning of my workday. </p><p>without this morning ritual, the practices that I'd do no matter what is only two out of eight: eat breakfast + walk luna.
