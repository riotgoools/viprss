I’m already paying for it through our <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/apple-one/\">Apple One</a> family subscription, so I figured why not? I do like Fastmail’s service and recommend them to people over Google all the time. My main domain is hosted on <a href=\"https://workspace.google.com/\">Google Workspace</a> and while I would love nothing more than to ungoogle my life, their services are great and prefer Meet over Zoom or (shudder) Teams.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"micro.brad","siteHash":"27daae1c149c6ec5a964b1fe9266f5a58f96cfb4b36e39006f255c6b2b53a76d","entryHash":"b6523f75ff3904fb734308f8b9f2d6774e309b445073f2680f1a8c4ac65c6395","category":"default"}
