They created what has become a 1.4 Trillion economy and then just walked away. They gave it to the world and said “it is yours”.</p>\n<p>Vitalik stuck around but has taken a similar approach. He has welcomed other entrepreneurs to create systems that take value away from the Ethereum blockchain. I would say he has even encouraged it.</p>\n<p>How can giving something away or letting others take value from you be good business?</p>\n<p>It is all about zero sum thinking. If you think that the size of the pie is fixed, then you need to grab as much of it as you can. But if you are making a pie that can grow and grow and grow, you just take a small slice and let everyone else eat.</p>\n<p>That is the Satoshi mic drop.</p>\n<p>And it is the key to winning onchain.</p>\n<p>Don’t be selfish.</p>\n<p>Be generous.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.usv.com/writing/2024/05/be-generous/\">Be Generous</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.usv.com\">Union Square Ventures</a>.</p>","author":"Fred Wilson","siteTitle":"http://www.usv.com/feed","siteHash":"628cf95acf2204bb0b1633ad294b90483a47fc067742fc28c14bbe7ca7e45bd8","entryHash":"05abd425784b39d39f0667307c0d3df34808cc4ec2c9bc4c11936e6386839887","category":"default"}
