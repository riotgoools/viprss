Milan Kundera understood this when he wrote in <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2023/09/11/milan-kundera-coincidenes/\"><em>The Unbearable Lightness of Being</em></a> that “the only truly serious questions are ones that even a child can formulate” — questions without answers “that set the limits of human possibilities, describe the boundaries of human experience.” I read (and <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2021/01/02/the-snail-with-the-right-heart/\">write</a>) children’s books to broaden those boundaries, to deepen my questions, to magnify my sense of the possible.</p>\n<p>After the year’s <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2023/12/19/favorite-books-of-2023/\">favorite books for grownups</a>, here are a handful of children’s books I read and loved and wrote about this year that emanate these qualities of questioning, consolation, of wonder and self-transcendence.</p>\n<h5>BUNNY &amp; TREE</h5>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Bunny-Tree-Balint-Zsako/dp/1592703933/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bunnyandtree_cover.jpg?resize=768%2C988&amp;ssl=1\" /></a>We spend our lives yearning to be saved — from harm and heartache, from ourselves, from the inevitability of our oblivion. Religions have taught that a god saves us. Kierkegaard thought that <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2022/09/23/kierkegaard-diary/\">we save ourselves</a>. Baldwin believed that <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2020/04/23/james-baldwin-nothing-personal-4-am/\">we save each other</a>, if we are lucky. Ultimately, we don’t know, or only think we know, what saves us. But when it happens, we hold on to our saviors with the full force of gratitude and grace. In every true friendship, each is the other’s savior, over and over.</p>\n<p>That is what Hungarian artist <strong>Balint Zsako</strong> explores with great subtlety and sweetness in <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Bunny-Tree-Balint-Zsako/dp/1592703933/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>Bunny &amp; Tree</em></strong></a> — a strange and wondrous wordless picture-book about a bunny saved from the archetypal hungry wolf by an unlikely savior — a sentient tree — and the unlikely friendship that blooms between them.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Bunny-Tree-Balint-Zsako/dp/1592703933/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bunnyandtree1.jpg?resize=680%2C874&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"680\" height=\"874\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bunnyandtree1.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bunnyandtree1.jpg?resize=320%2C411&amp;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bunnyandtree1.jpg?resize=600%2C772&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bunnyandtree1.jpg?resize=240%2C309&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bunnyandtree1.jpg?resize=768%2C988&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bunnyandtree1.jpg?resize=1195%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 1195w\" /></a></p>\n<p>The story begins with Tree sprouting into life against Zsako’s exquisite watercolor skyscapes. Season after season, Tree grows in vigor and beauty — a <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2022/05/20/trees-at-night-helene-johnson-rebecca-solnit/\">“silent sentinel”</a> to the

touch another, express its joys and sorrows to another — this is the great miracle of being alive together. The object of human communication is not the exchange of information but the exchange of understanding. If we are lucky enough, if we are attentive enough, communication then becomes a system for the transfer of tenderness. That we have invented so many forms of it — the language of words, the language of music, the language of flowers — is a testament to our elemental need for this exchange.</p>\n<p>A bright and immeasurably tender celebration of that need comes from French author Élise Fontenaille and Spanish artist <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2018/10/09/the-forest-riccardo-bozzi/\">Violeta Lópiz</a> in their lovely collaboration <a href=\"https://enchantedlion.com/all-books/at-the-drop-of-a-cat\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>At the Drop of a Cat</em></strong></a> (<a href=\"https://search.worldcat.org/title/1334895182\" target=\"_blank\"><em>public library</em></a>).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://enchantedlion.com/all-books/at-the-drop-of-a-cat\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/atthedropofacat1.jpg?resize=680%2C939&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"680\" height=\"939\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/atthedropofacat1.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/atthedropofacat1.jpg?resize=320%2C442&amp;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/atthedropofacat1.jpg?resize=600%2C829&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/atthedropofacat1.jpg?resize=240%2C331&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/atthedropofacat1.jpg?resize=768%2C1060&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/atthedropofacat1.jpg?resize=1112%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 1112w\" /></a></p>\n<p>We meet a six-year-old boy just learning to read and write in his grandfather Luis’s house — a house Luis has built with his own hands, surrounded by a garden full of artichokes the size of heads and green beans climbing into the sky — a garden that “feels like a whole other world.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://enchantedlion.com/all-books/at-the-drop-of-a-cat\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/atthedropofacat2.jpg?resize=680%2C939&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"680\" height=\"939\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/atthedropofacat2.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/atthedropofacat2.jpg?resize=320%2C442&amp;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/atthedropofacat2.jpg?resize=600%2C829&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/atthedropofacat2.jpg?resize=240%2C331&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/atthedropofacat2.jpg?resize=768%2C1060&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/atthedropofacat2.jpg?resize=1112%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 1112w\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://enchantedlion.com/all-books/at-the-drop-of-a-cat\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/atthedropofacat21.jpg?resize=680%2C460&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"680\" height=\"460\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/atthedropofacat21.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/atthedropofacat21.jpg?resize=320%2C216&amp;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/atthedropofacat21.jpg?resize=600%2C406&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/atthedropofacat21.jpg?resize=240%2C162&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/atthedropofacat21.jpg?resize=768%2C519&amp;ssl=1 768w\" /></a></p>\n<p>Through the little boy’s unjudging eyes, in illustrations as textured and layered as a life well lived, a loving portrait of Luis emerges — his green thumb and the way he “speaks bird language,” his gifts for painting and cooking, his many tattoos, his thick Spanish accent and his charming misuse of idioms: He calls his grandson “the apple of his pie” and loves the expression “at the drop of a cat,” of which the little boy is so fond that he continues using it in school despite his teacher’s correction. </p>\n<p>As the portrait unfolds, we realize that Luis misuses idioms because he has only ever heard them spoken, in a foreign tongue: When he was a little boy himself, having spent his childhood working in the fields, he fled war-torn Spain and “crossed mountains and hills and the countryside until he got to France.” He never went to school, never learned to write. Instead, he developed his own language of belonging — a living lexicon for feeling at home in the living world.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://enchantedlion.com/all-books/at-the-drop-of-a-cat\"

href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2022/03/06/is-peace-possible-kathleen-lonsdale/\">the building blocks of peace</a>, the pioneering crystallographer and peace activist Kathleen Lonsdale located that formula in the moral education of our young — in teaching children, who are both the most vulnerable victims of war and the soldiers of the future, “at whatever cost not to give way to wrong or to co-operate in it.” </p>\n<p>My grandmother was a child in Bulgaria when the bombs of WWII rained down upon her and her three siblings, seeding into her marrow a lifetime of paralyzing anxiety that to this day never leaves her — not even in the safest of circumstances, not even with the sanest of her engineer’s reasoning. These scars that war leaves on the souls of children are a living testament to the great cellist Pablo Casals’s insistence that our primary motive force for ending violence should be <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2016/03/10/pablo-casals-joys-and-sorrows-jfk/\">“to make this world worthy of its children.”</a></p>\n<p>How children survive the unsurvivable, how they keep the

Except they were not particles — they were birds. Thousands of them. A murmuration of starlings — swarm intelligence at its most majestic, emergence incarnate, a living reminder that the universe is <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2023/08/27/notes-on-complexity-neil-theise/\">“nothing but a vast, self-organizing, complex system, the emergent properties of which are…

And yet even so, we have only explored about a tenth of the world’s waters. The oceans, which comprise 99% of the living space on our planet and make it a world, remain largely a mystery — the mystery out of which we emerged to walk the land, to make books and mathematics, to invent sonar and love. </p>\n<p>Author Jennifer Berne and artist Amanda Hall celebrate our footholds of knowledge amid the mystery in <a

</p>\n<p>That wondrous interleaving of space, time, and being comes alive with uncommon sweetness in <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Lost-Drop-Grégoire-Laforce/dp/199025229X/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>The Lost Drop</em></strong></a> (<a href=\"https://www.worldcat.org/title/1369497986\" target=\"_blank\"><em>public library</em></a>) by Grégoire Laforce, illustrated by Benjamin Flouw — a vibrant love letter to the water cycle as a portal to deep time and deep presence, and a subtle celebration of the ongoingness of life as a way to bear our mortal smallness in the great scheme of being. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Lost-Drop-Grégoire-Laforce/dp/199025229X/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\"

Someday it will swallow every atom that ever touched us and every datum we ever produced, swallow Euclid’s postulates and the <em>Goldberg Variations</em>, calculus and <em>Leaves of Grass</em>.</p>\n<p>When black holes first emerged from the mathematics of <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2019/07/11/stephon-alexander-rebecca-elson-explaining-relativity/\">relativity</a>, Einstein himself wavered on whether or not they could be real — he struggled to imagine that nature could produce so menacing a thing, that spacetime could bend to such a monstrous extreme. And then it took us a mere century to hear with our <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2016/04/25/black-hole-blues-janna-levin-joseph-weber/\">immense prosthetic ear</a> the sound of two black holes colliding to churn a gravitational wave, then to see with our telescopic eye <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BwE_g1mDMnN/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==\" target=\"_blank\">an actual black hole</a> in the cosmic wild. Here looms living proof of Richard Feynman’s insistence that <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2013/07/19/richard-feynman-science-morality-poem/\">“the imagination of nature is far, far greater than the imagination of man.”</a></p>\n<p>With their cosmic drama and their dazzling science at the edge of the possible, black holes beckon the human imagination with myriad metaphors for our existential perplexities. One of them comes alive in <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Little-Black-Hole-Molly-Webster/dp/0593464753/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>Little Black Hole</em></strong></a> (<a href=\"https://www.worldcat.org/title/1378487994\" target=\"_blank\"><em>public library</em></a>), by<br />\n<em>Radiolab</em> producer <strong>Molly Webster</strong> and artist <strong>Alex Willmore</strong> — an uncommon meditation on how to live with the austere existential loneliness of knowing that everything and everyone we cherish can be taken away from us and is ultimately destined for oblivion, how to live with the looming loss that is the price of being fully alive. </p>\n<p>The story’s central conceit draws on Stephen Hawking’s <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2019/11/19/stephen-hawking-black-hole-information-paradox-explained/\">black hole information paradox</a> — the combined intimation of relativity and quantum field theory that, even though not even light can escape from a black hole, bits of information can transcend its immense gravitational pull and break free in the form of what is known as Hawking radiation. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Little-Black-Hole-Molly-Webster/dp/0593464753/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/littleblackhole7.jpg?resize=680%2C338&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"680\" height=\"338\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/littleblackhole7.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/littleblackhole7.jpg?resize=320%2C159&amp;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/littleblackhole7.jpg?resize=600%2C298&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/littleblackhole7.jpg?resize=240%2C119&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/littleblackhole7.jpg?resize=768%2C381&amp;ssl=1 768w\" /></a></p>\n<p>Tucked into the lyrical opening lines is a subtle vulpine allusion to <em>The Little Prince</em>, that most poetic of cosmic tales:</p>\n<blockquote><p>There once was a little black hole who loved everything in the universe.</p>\n<p>The stars. The planets. The space rocks and the space fox. Even the flying astronauts.</p>\n<p>The little black hole loved her friends.</p></blockquote>\n<p>One day, the little black hole befriends a star, but just as they are delighting in building a cosmic castle together, the star vanishes, her light nowhere to be seen. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Little-Black-Hole-Molly-Webster/dp/0593464753/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/littleblackhole2.jpg?resize=680%2C521&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"680\" height=\"521\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/littleblackhole2.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/littleblackhole2.jpg?resize=320%2C245&amp;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/littleblackhole2.jpg?resize=600%2C460&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/littleblackhole2.jpg?resize=240%2C184&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/littleblackhole2.jpg?resize=768%2C588&amp;ssl=1 768w\" /></a></p>\n<p>Next, a comet swings by, but just as the little black hole grows giddy for a new friendship, the comet crumbles to cosmic dust and disappears. </p>\n<p>So they come and they go, the planets and the asteroids, the fox and the astronauts, each new friend taken away as soon as they get close, leaving the little black hole baffled and bereaved. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Little-Black-Hole-Molly-Webster/dp/0593464753/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/littleblackhole6.jpg?resize=680%2C573&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"680\" height=\"573\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/littleblackhole6.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/littleblackhole6.jpg?resize=320%2C270&amp;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/littleblackhole6.jpg?resize=600%2C506&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/littleblackhole6.jpg?resize=240%2C202&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/littleblackhole6.jpg?resize=768%2C647&amp;ssl=1 768w\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Little-Black-Hole-Molly-Webster/dp/0593464753/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/littleblackhole3.jpg?resize=680%2C636&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"680\" height=\"636\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/littleblackhole3.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/littleblackhole3.jpg?resize=320%2C299&amp;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/littleblackhole3.jpg?resize=600%2C561&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/littleblackhole3.jpg?resize=240%2C224&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/littleblackhole3.jpg?resize=768%2C718&amp;ssl=1 768w\" /></a></p>\n<p>Confused and disconsolate, the little black hole comes upon a big black hole replete with <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2023/07/29/excellent-advice-for-living-kevin-kelly/\">an elder’s wisdom</a>, who illuminates the fundamental fact that to be a black hole means to swallow and annihilate anything and anyone who comes near. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Little-Black-Hole-Molly-Webster/dp/0593464753/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/littleblackhole4.jpg?resize=680%2C517&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"680\" height=\"517\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/littleblackhole4.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/littleblackhole4.jpg?resize=320%2C243&amp;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/littleblackhole4.jpg?resize=600%2C457&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/littleblackhole4.jpg?resize=240%2C183&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/littleblackhole4.jpg?resize=768%2C584&amp;ssl=1 768w\" /></a></p>\n<p>And yet bits of information can escape from the belly of the black hole, bubbling back up as remnants of what was consumed. Out of Hawking’s legacy arises the story’s central metaphor for how to live with loss: Because, in poet Meghan O’Rourke’s lovely words, <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2014/06/09/meghan-o-rourke-the-long-goodbye/\">“the people we most love do become a physical part of us, ingrained in our synapses, in the pathways where memories are created,”</a> we can always bring them back up to the surface of our consciousness with the twin levers of memory and imagination. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Little-Black-Hole-Molly-Webster/dp/0593464753/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/littleblackhole5.jpg?resize=680%2C338&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"680\" height=\"338\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/littleblackhole5.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/littleblackhole5.jpg?resize=320%2C159&amp;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/littleblackhole5.jpg?resize=600%2C298&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/littleblackhole5.jpg?resize=240%2C119&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/littleblackhole5.jpg?resize=768%2C381&amp;ssl=1 768w\" /></a></p>\n<p>This might seem like cold consolation for the infernal heat of loss. And yet it is no small gift that <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2022/08/22/victor-johnston-consciousness/\">a cold cosmos kindled the warm glow of consciousness</a> — this radiant faculty that makes it possible to love and to suffer, to imagine and to remember; this wonder that — like music, like love — didn’t have to exist. </p>\n<hr /><h3>donating = loving</h3><p>For seventeen years, I have been spending hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars each month composing <em>The Marginalian</em> (which <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2021/10/22/brain-pickings-becoming-the-marginalian/\">bore the outgrown name <em>Brain Pickings</em></a> for its first fifteen years).
