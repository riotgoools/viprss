That's never worked for us, in fact it's worked against us. Trump's election in 2016, for example, could he have done it without Twitter letting him go direct to organize? </p>\n<p>The Harris organization is doing great, they have to take on the journalists, where previous Democrats had no answer, they've done it in a clever way, by using their channels to talk about the things journalism should be talking about. People listen to their competition, and that's what this is. </p>\n<p>It's not hard to do this, a few of us, who are good listeners and writers, to build lists of sources and provide them for people to access away from the nonstop (often entertaining) bullshit of the social web of 2024.</p>\n<p>I've asked for ideas for podcasts that would go into a list of shows people who are voting Democratic would find interesting or useful. Not for spreading religion, but based on facts, not the unhinged lunacy and revenge of Trump. Our news now is too polluted by that. He shouldn't be able to lie about Harris's race, and have that be an issue carried by journalism, for example. That should not be possible but it happens. </p>\n<p>Podcast: <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2024/08/04/timeToCreateOurOwnMediaAgain.m4a\">12 minutes</a>. </p>\n<p>PS: Here's a computer-generated <a href=\"https://recorder.google.com/b5aa5e3f-2164-4005-a302-38d5919775eb\">transcript</a>.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"f408d0e4192f15f881b1906fb296836c4306de34f85a5029da683c4f7ec8610e","category":"default"}
