In my 2011 book <em>The Great Stagnation</em>, I blame the disappearance of the low-hanging fruit that resulted from powerful machines and plentiful fossil fuels.</p>\r\n<p>Some of those likely are factors. Now an economist, Nicholas Reynolds of the University of Essex, claims to <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://nreynolds88.github.io/nicholas-reynolds.com/reynolds_cohort_decline_short.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">have found</a> a new villain in this economic story: a negative shock to the quality of human capital in America.</p>\r\n<p>Americans born after 1947 and before the mid-1960s — the first of whom were just entering their prime working years in 1971 — did not see economic gains comparable to those of their predecessors. But the problems of this cohort are more far-reaching. They had more problems as young children, and they did worse in school in the 1960s, accounting for the educational declines of that era, such as lower test scores and higher dropout rates.</p>\r\n<p>Birthweights also declined in the 1980s, a sign that the post-1947 cohort was less healthy, most of all when it comes to maternal health. You might think that development is due to intervening economic factors. But the post-1947 world is still wealthier than what came before, so it is not obvious why an economic <em>slowdown</em>, but not absolute decline, should have created such significant health problems.</p>\r\n<p>It’s not just that Americans born after 1955 <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1540-6237.2007.00458.x\" target=\"_blank\">stopped getting taller</a>, whereas Europeans didn’t. There are deeper problems, such as the alarming rise in the <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.pnas.org/cgk/doi/10.1073/pnas.1518393112\" target=\"_blank\">midlife mortality rate</a> since 1999. These “deaths of despair” may also be a legacy from this 1947 break in Americans’ quality of health.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>I am not sure that is all true, but if so it is very important and would constitute a significant revision in our understanding of 20th century economic history.  And what happened in the late 1940s?  There it gets tricky:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>The obvious question is what exactly happened in about 1947 to put the US on this less constructive path. There is no obvious smoking gun, but the cohort decline seems to start in adolescence, prior to entering labor markets. So perhaps it is something in the structure of American society, or in US public health practices, rather than stemming from traditional macroeconomic factors.</p>\r\n<p>One possible cause is an increase in postwar automobile usage, and thus higher levels of lead exposure, given the lead additives in gasoline at the time. There is no direct evidence for this claim, but lead has been shown to have significant <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.epa.gov/lead/what-are-some-health-effects-lead\" target=\"_blank\">negative</a> impacts on human development, and some researchers <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead%E2%80%93crime_hypothesis#:~:text=%22The%20Lead%2DCrime%20Hypothesis%3A,criminal%20behavior%2C%20particularly%20violent%20crimes.\" target=\"_blank\">blame</a> it for the later higher US crime rates.</p>\r\n<p>Still, it is not obvious why lead should lead to such a sharp break in the data. And if lead is the main culprit, then there should be major improvements forthcoming, as lead additives were fully <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/gasoline/gasoline-and-the-environment-leaded-gasoline.php\" target=\"_blank\">banned</a> from American gasoline in 1996, with a phase-out starting in the 1970s.</p>\r\n<p>A second possibility is that the baby boom generation was so large that there was a decline in quality of care given to each child.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Very much worth a ponder, and then some.</p>\r\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/08/was-the-great-stagnation-originally-a-problem-of-human-capital.html\">Was the Great Stagnation originally a problem of human capital?</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com\">Marginal REVOLUTION</a>.</p>\r\n<img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/903621416/0/marginalrevolution\" />\r\n<div><a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/903621416/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/903621416/marginalrevolution,\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/903621416/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/x.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/903621416/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/903621416/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/08/was-the-great-stagnation-originally-a-problem-of-human-capital.html#comments\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/comments20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/08/was-the-great-stagnation-originally-a-problem-of-human-capital.html/feed\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/commentsrss20.png\" /></a> \r\n<div><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/08/was-the-great-stagnation-originally-a-problem-of-human-capital.html#comments\"><h3>Comments</h3></a><ul><li><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/08/was-the-great-stagnation-originally-a-problem-of-human-capital.html#comment-160804744\">The elephant in the room: college enrollment soared during the ...</a> <i>by rayward</i></li><li><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/08/was-the-great-stagnation-originally-a-problem-of-human-capital.html#comment-160804743\">In reply to Ellis Green.
