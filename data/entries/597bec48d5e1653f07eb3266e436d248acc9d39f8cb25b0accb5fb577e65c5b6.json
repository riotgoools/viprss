Don’t worry. I’m fine!”\nThen she walked me into her living room.\nWalked.\n</p><p>\nTurns out I had misunderstood.\nYes she fractured a couple vertebrae but it never stopped her from walking.\nShe said “that little accident” helped her pay more attention to her fitness, and since then has been in better health than ever.\nThen she apologized for causing the accident in the first place.\nApologized.\n</p><p>\nI said, “Well, no, it was my fault for ignoring the yield sign.”\n</p><p>\nShe said, “No, it was my fault because I was eating while driving and not watching the road. You didn’t hit me. I hit you.”\n</p><p>\nSeems we had both thought the accident was our fault, and had spent eighteen years feeling bad about it.\nThis time she started crying, sniffled, grabbed a tissue to wipe her eyes and said, “It’s so <em>stupid</em> - these stories.”\n</p>\n<hr />\n<p>\nAim a laser pointer at the moon, then move your hand the tiniest bit, and it’ll move a thousand miles at the other end.\nThe tiniest misunderstanding long ago, amplified through time, leads to piles of misunderstandings in the present.\n</p><p>\nWe think of the past like it’s a physical fact - like it’s real.\nBut the past is what we call our memory and stories about it.\nImperfect memories, and stories built on one interpretation of incomplete information.\nThat’s “<em>the</em> past”.\n</p><p>\n<strong>\nYou can change your history.\n</strong>\nThe actual factual events are such a small part of it.\nEverything else is perspective, open for re-interpretation.\nThe past is never done.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/ashclements/290493334/\"><img src=\"/images/crashedcar.jpg\" alt=\"crashed car photo by Ashley Jonathan Clements\" /></a>\n<figcaption>photo by <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/ashclements/290493334/\">Ashley Jonathan Clements</a></figcaption>\n</figure>","author":"Derek Sivers","siteTitle":"Derek Sivers","siteHash":"4098504c0d0759e13901f29e63f7d7dbb1d972a078c6dc4560660f373da5c25e","entryHash":"597bec48d5e1653f07eb3266e436d248acc9d39f8cb25b0accb5fb577e65c5b6","category":"Sites"}
