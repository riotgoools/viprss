I bought one on <a href=\"https://parentdata.org/from-the-archive-your-best-parenting-advice/\">a recommendation</a> from parenting writer and economist Emily Oster, and itâ€™s been one of the best kid purchases Iâ€™ve made. I carried my toddler in it every day until I got too pregnant with our second child, but Iâ€™m psyched to bring it back this year. Itâ€™s super minimal and easy to put on, with a weight limit of 40 pounds. Thereâ€™s a slight learning curve to put the child in unassisted, but we got pretty good at it after a while. Way more fun than wearing the baby on the front! (And it looks like they also sell it at <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/BityBean-UltraCompact-Baby-Carrier-Lime-Green/41051687\">Walmart</a>.)</p>\n\n <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/babies\">babies</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/illustrated%20product%20recommendations\">illustrated product recommendations</a></p>\n\n <p>ðŸ’¬ <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/03/random-product-rec-the-bitybean-backpack-kid-carrier\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> â†’</p>\n\n    ","author":"Edith Zimmerman","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"e2e75820d65909f82c72251810eb2bd6c72146e4eab8bbaa0d4710b5383f6948","category":"default"}
