Going back to your childhood, what were some of your favorite books during some of those formative years?</span></div>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</section>\r\n<article>\r\n<section>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<blockquote><p><strong>Tyler:</strong> Well, when I was very small, my favorite books were about animals and dinosaurs. A bit later, I liked books about codes and ciphers. I loved baseball books. I loved Jerry Kramer’s Instant Replay. Chess books, of course, when I was a chess player. Maybe when I was 11, I started reading science fiction. So, Isaac Asimov, Arthur C. Clarke, a little later, Robert Heinlein. Those were many of the first things I read.</p></blockquote>\r\n<p>And this:</p>\r\n<blockquote><p><strong>Thomas</strong>: …if I’m very well informed about something? Why shouldn’t I go marching to Capitol Hill and shout from the top of my lungs that things must be this way to have a better future?</p>\r\n<p><strong>Tyler:</strong> Well, I’m not sure how much being well informed predicts you being right. That’s an interesting question, Now, clearly, society relies on the fact that many people will go out and march for things, even when they’re not well informed. So, I don’t want to talk everyone out of that. But it still seems to me the wisest people, or people who are trying to be the wisest people, should be much more careful, and do more to listen, and set an example toward humility. While recognizing you need a lot of dogmatists fighting for a bunch of things to keep society sustainable.</p></blockquote>\r\n<p>Many further topics are discussed, interesting throughout.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</section>\r\n</article>\r\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/03/my-podcast-with-thomas-burnett.html\">My podcast with Thomas Burnett</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com\">Marginal REVOLUTION</a>.</p>\r\n<img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/873780092/0/marginalrevolution\" />\r\n<div><a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/873780092/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/873780092/marginalrevolution,\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/873780092/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/x.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/873780092/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/873780092/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/03/my-podcast-with-thomas-burnett.html#comments\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/comments20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/03/my-podcast-with-thomas-burnett.html/feed\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/commentsrss20.png\" /></a> \r\n<div><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/03/my-podcast-with-thomas-burnett.html#comments\"><h3>Comments</h3></a><ul><li><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/03/my-podcast-with-thomas-burnett.html#comment-160731007\">Short conversation, but Tyler managed to get in two rather loud ...</a> <i>by Exegete</i></li><li><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/03/my-podcast-with-thomas-burnett.html#comment-160731001\">Someone that asks the second question by definition is not ...</a> <i>by BC</i></li><li><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/03/my-podcast-with-thomas-burnett.html#comment-160730999\">Tyler:    Well, I’m not sure how much being well informed ...</a> <i>by MikeP</i></li><li><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/03/my-podcast-with-thomas-burnett.html#comment-160730997\">In reply to Justin Chang.
