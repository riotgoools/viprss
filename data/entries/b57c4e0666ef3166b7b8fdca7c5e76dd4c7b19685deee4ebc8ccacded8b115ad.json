{"title":"The NYT is weird","link":"http://scripting.com/2024/07/31/142559.html?title=theNytIsWeird","date":1722435959000,"content":"<p>Someone in charge at the NYT needs to take a step back and view events, and the NYT role in those events, from the point of view of an ordinary non-NYT-employed citizen, bewildered at the enormous risks journalists are taking with the system of government of the United States. </p>\n<p>In the context of who we are as a country, what the Repubs do and say is to be very mild about it \"weird.\" What word would you prefer the Democrats use? Imagine <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Safire\">William Safire</a> were here, the great linguist columnist of the NYT, wrote that column. (Safire was a <a href=\"https://chatgpt.com/share/ab14f5b9-2b55-406f-9b78-057313c03d63\">Republican</a> btw.)</p>\n<p>And to the Democrats, no matter what the NYT says, keep using the term. This is where you get to speak out about what they're doing over there, and how it's not journalism. One of the rare things you agree with Trump on. </p>\n<p>Podcast: <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2024/07/31/theNYTIsWeird.m4a\">3 minutes</a>.</p>\n<p>PS: Safire went to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronx_High_School_of_Science\">Bronx Science</a>! I did not know that. (So did I.) I love the idea of writers who aren't scared of tech stuff. </p>\n<p>PPS: Even Richard Nixon would think today's so-called Republicans were weird. </p>\n<p>PPPS: The NYT is totally unmoored, a word I bet Safire would like. </p>","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"b57c4e0666ef3166b7b8fdca7c5e76dd4c7b19685deee4ebc8ccacded8b115ad","category":"default"}
