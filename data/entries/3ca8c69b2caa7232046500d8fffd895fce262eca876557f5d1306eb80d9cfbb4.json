The Royal Astronomical Society and the British Film Institute <a href=\"https://player.bfi.org.uk/free/film/watch-solar-eclipse-1900-online\">reckon</a> this is “the first surviving astronomical film in the world”.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>In 1898 he travelled to India to photograph an eclipse. He succeeded but the film can was stolen on his return journey home. </p>\n\n<p>It was not an easy feat to film. Maskelyne had to make a special telescopic adapter for his camera to capture the event. This is the only film by Maskelyne that we know to have survived.</p>\n\n<p>The original film fragment held in The Royal Astronomical Society’s archive has been painstakingly scanned and restored in 4K by conservation experts at the BFI National Archive, who have reassembled and retimed the film frame by frame. The film is part of BFI Player’s recently released Victorian Film collection, viewers are now able to experience this first film of a solar eclipse since the event was originally captured over a century ago.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>(via <a href=\"https://boingboing.net/2024/04/03/this-1900-film-of-a-solar-eclipse-may-be-the-oldest-footage-of-an-astronomical-event-ever-video.html\">boing boing</a>)</p>\n\n <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/astronomy\">astronomy</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Nevil%20Maskelyne\">Nevil Maskelyne</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/science\">science</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Sun\">Sun</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/video\">video</a></p>\n\n <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/04/film-footage-of-a-total-solar-eclipse-from-1900\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"3ca8c69b2caa7232046500d8fffd895fce262eca876557f5d1306eb80d9cfbb4","category":"default"}
