That space expands in solitude. To create anything — a poem, a painting, a theorem — is to find the voice in the silence that has something to say to the world. In solitude, we may begin to hear in the silence the song of our own lives. “Give me solitude,” Whitman <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2014/07/01/walt-whitman-give-me-the-splendid-silent-sun/\">howled</a>, “give me again O Nature your primal sanities!” </p>\n<p>Gathered here are some of my favorite voices in praise of solitude, of its ample creative and spiritual rewards, its primal sanities.</p>\n<figure><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/solitude-by-maria-popova_print?sku=s6-11544229p4a1v2?curator=brainpicker\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Solitude-by-Maria-Popova.jpg?resize=680%2C907&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"680\" height=\"907\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Solitude-by-Maria-Popova.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Solitude-by-Maria-Popova.jpg?resize=240%2C320&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Solitude-by-Maria-Popova.jpg?resize=320%2C427&amp;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Solitude-by-Maria-Popova.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Solitude-by-Maria-Popova.jpg?resize=600%2C800&amp;ssl=1 600w\" /></a><figcaption><em>Solitude</em> by Maria Popova.

Shortly after Rilke’s death of leukemia, Kappus published the correspondence. <em>Letters to a Young Poet</em> came to stand as one of the finest books of the past century. In a <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1611806860/braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\">wonderful new translation</a> by ecological philosopher, Buddhist scholar, and environmental activist Joanna Macy, and poet and clinical psychologist Anita Barrows, Rilke writes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>What (you might ask yourself) would a solitude be that didn’t have some greatness to it? For there is only one solitude, and it is large and not easy to bear. It comes almost all the time when you’d gladly exchange it for any togetherness, however banal and cheap; exchange it for the appearance of however strong a conformity with the ordinary, with the least worthy. But perhaps that is precisely the time when solitude ripens; its ripening can be painful as the growth of a boy and sad like the beginning of spring… What is needed is only this: solitude, great inner solitude. Going within and meeting no one else for hours — that is what one must learn to attain. To be solitary as one was as a child. As the grown-ups were moving about, preoccupied with things that seemed big and important because the grown-ups appeared so busy and because you couldn’t understand what they were doing.</p></blockquote>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2021/12/16/before-i-grew-up-miller-cucco/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/beforeigrewup10-scaled.jpg\" /></a><figcaption>Art by Giuliano Cucco from <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2021/12/16/before-i-grew-up-miller-cucco/\"><em>Before I Grew Up</em></a> by John Miller</figcaption></figure>\n<p></p><h5>MAY SARTON</h5><p></p>\n<p>A lifetime after she composed <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2017/12/01/may-sarton-canticle-6-considerations/\">her stunning ode to solitude</a> as a young poet, after she contemplated <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2016/10/17/may-sarton-journal-of-a-solitude-depression/\">solitude as the seedbed of self-discovery</a> upon entering her sixties, <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/tag/may-sarton\">May Sarton</a> (May 3, 1912–July 16, 1995) moved to Maine to spend the last chapter of her life living alone in a house with a garden on the edge of the sea. Friends came to visit, as did strangers who admired her poetry and had found her address in the phone book — those were the days — but she cherished her solitude above even the most welcome company. </p>\n<p>In a passage from her boundlessly rewarding journal <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/House-Sea-Journal-May-Sarton/dp/0393313905/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>The House by the Sea</em></strong></a> (<a href=\"https://www.worldcat.org/title/2964402\" target=\"_blank\"><em>public library</em></a>) — which gave us her meditations on <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2023/04/18/may-sarton-gardening-writing/\">the relationship between gardening and writing</a>, <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2023/03/17/may-sarton-talent/\">how to cultivate your talent</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2023/05/17/may-sarton-living-alone/\">the art of living alone</a> — Sarton considers the tilting balance of her life. Reflecting on her approach to visitors, she writes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I try to see them one at a time. I mean every encounter here to be more than superficial, to be a real exchange of lives, and this is more easily accomplished one to one than in a group. But the continuity is solitude. Without long periods here alone, especially in winter when visits are rare, I would have nothing to give, and would be less open to the gifts offered me. Solitude has replaced the single intense relationship, the passionate love that even at Nelson [Sarton’s prior home] focused all the rest. Solitude, like a long love, deepens with time, and, I trust, will not fail me if my own powers of creation diminish. For growing into solitude is one way of growing to the end.</p></blockquote>\n<figure><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/spring-moon-at-ninomiya-beach-by-hasui-kawase-1931_print?sku=s6-19564891p4a1v46?curator=brainpicker\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/hasuikawase1.jpg?resize=680%2C1014&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"680\" height=\"1014\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/hasuikawase1.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/hasuikawase1.jpg?resize=320%2C477&amp;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/hasuikawase1.jpg?resize=600%2C895&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/hasuikawase1.jpg?resize=240%2C358&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/hasuikawase1.jpg?resize=768%2C1146&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/hasuikawase1.jpg?resize=1030%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 1030w\" /></a><figcaption><em>Spring Moon at Ninomiya Beach</em>, 1931 — one of Hasui Kawase’s <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2021/03/22/hasui-kawase-prints/\">stunning vintage Japanese woodblocks</a>.

In a <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2022/08/09/walden-solitude/\">long meditation on solitude and the meaning of life</a>, he writes in <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Walden-Yale-Nota-Henry-Thoreau/dp/0300110081/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>Walden</em></strong></a> (<a href=\"http://www.worldcat.org/title/walden-and-other-writings/oclc/275671&amp;referer=brief_results\" target=\"_blank\"><em>public library</em></a> | <a href=\"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/205\" target=\"_blank\"><em>public domain</em></a>):</p>\n<blockquote><p>It is as solitary where I live as on the prairies. It is as much Asia or Africa as New England. I have, as it were, my own sun and moon and stars, and a little world all to myself.</p>\n<p>[…]</p>\n<p>I find it wholesome to be alone the greater part of the time. To be in company, even with the best, is soon wearisome and dissipating. I love to be alone. I never found the companion that was so companionable as solitude. We are for the most part more lonely when we go [out among others] than when we stay in our chambers.</p></blockquote>\n<p>For Thoreau, who suffered bouts of debilitating depression and <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2023/03/01/thoreau-grief/\">black grief</a>, solitude was not a way of caving in on himself, as one does in loneliness, but a way of unselfing, of stepping beyond his small human turmoils and into the wider universe that holds:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The most sweet and tender, the most innocent and encouraging society may be found in any natural object, even for the poor misanthrope and most melancholy man. There can be no very black melancholy to him who lives in the midst of Nature and has his senses still.</p></blockquote>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2013/07/25/ruth-krauss-maurice-sendak-open-house-for-butterflies/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/openhouseforbutterflies18.jpg?w=680&amp;ssl=1\" /></a><figcaption>Illustration by Maurice Sendak from <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2013/07/25/ruth-krauss-maurice-sendak-open-house-for-butterflies/\"><em>Open House for Butterflies</em></a> by Ruth Krauss</figcaption></figure>\n<h5>SANTIAGO RAMÓN Y CAJAL</h5>\n<p>In the last years of the nineteenth century, shortly after he originated an entire new field we now call neuroscience and a decade before he won the Nobel Prize for establishing the neuron as the basic unit of the nervous system, <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/tag/santiago-ramon-y-cajal\">Santiago Ramón y Cajal</a> (May 1, 1852–October 17, 1934) composed a short, passionate book titled <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Advice-Young-Investigator-MIT-Press/dp/0262681501/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>Advice for a Young Investigator</em></strong></a> (<a href=\"http://www.worldcat.org/title/advice-for-a-young-investigator/oclc/56454151&amp;referer=brief_results\" target=\"_blank\"><em>public library</em></a>), predating Rilke’s <em>Letters to a Young Poet</em> by three decades. In it, he outlined <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2017/03/17/diseases-of-the-will-cajal-advice-for-a-young-investigator/\">the six psychological flaws that keep the talented from reaching greatness</a> and pointed to solitude as the supreme incubator of true originality. He writes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Our major commitment … is to discover ourselves before discovering scientific truth, to mold ourselves before molding nature. To fashion a strong brain, an original mind that is ours alone — this is the preliminary work that is absolutely essential.</p>\n<p>[…]</p>\n<p>Oh comforting solitude, how favorable thou art to original thought! How satisfying and rewarding are the long winter evenings spent in the <em>private laboratory</em>, at the very time when educational centers are closed to their workers! Such evenings free us from poorly thought out improvisations, strengthen our patience, and refine our powers of observation.</p></blockquote>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2021/12/16/before-i-grew-up-miller-cucco/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/beforeigrewup1.jpg\" /></a><figcaption>Art by Giuliano Cucco from <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2021/12/16/before-i-grew-up-miller-cucco/\"><em>Before I Grew Up</em></a></figcaption></figure>\n<h5>WENDELL BERRY</h5>\n<p>In his splendid poem <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2021/03/12/wendell-berry-the-peace-of-wild-things-animated/\">“The Peace of Wild Things,”</a> poet and farmer <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/tag/wendell-berry\">Wendell Berry</a> located the remedy for despair in learning to “rest in the grace of the world,” which is most readily found amid wild solitude. He deepens the sentiment in one of the essays from his altogether wonderful and wonderfully titled essay collection <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/What-Are-People-For-Essays/dp/1582434875/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>What Are People For?</em></strong></a> (<a href=\"http://www.worldcat.org/title/what-are-people-for-essays/oclc/20629876&amp;referer=brief_results\" target=\"_blank\"><em>public library</em></a>). Reflecting on <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2014/12/17/wendell-berry-pride-despair-solitude/\">the antidote to the two great enemies of creativity</a>, Berry writes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We enter solitude, in which also we lose loneliness…</p>\n<p>True solitude is found in the wild places, where one is without human obligation.</p>\n<p>One’s inner voices become audible. One feels the attraction of one’s most intimate sources.</p>\n<p>In consequence, one responds more clearly to other lives. The more coherent one becomes within oneself as a creature, the more fully one enters into the communion of all creatures.</p></blockquote>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2023/11/16/at-the-drop-of-a-cat/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/atthedropofacat1.jpg\" /></a><figcaption>Art by Violeta Lópiz for <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2023/11/16/at-the-drop-of-a-cat/\"><em>At the Drop of a Cat</em></a></figcaption></figure>\n<h5>ROSE MACAULAY</h5>\n<p>Often, it is only when something is taken away that we fully appreciate its value; in being famished for it, we remember how deeply it nourishes us.

A peace for gods; a divine emptiness.</p>\n<p>[…]</p>\n<p>The easy chair spreads wide arms of welcome; the sofa stretches, guest-free; the books gleam, brown and golden, buff and blue and maroon, from their shelves; they may strew the floor, the chairs, the couch, once more, lying ready to the hand… The echo of the foolish words lingers on the air, is brushed away, dies forgotten, the air closes behind it. A heavy volume is heaved from its shelf on to the sofa. Silence drops like falling blossoms over the recovered kingdom… It is a gift, a miracle, a golden jewel, a fragment of some gracious heavenly order, dropped to earth like some incredible strayed star.

By isolating yourself, you can see more clearly what distinguishes you from other people. Standing out in this way serves to affirm your existence (<em>ex</em>-[out] + <em>sistere</em> [stand]). Liberated from social pressures and constraints, solitude can help you understand better what kind of person you are and what your life is for. In this way you become independent of others. You find your own path, your own voice.</p>\n<p>[…]</p>\n<p>Here lies the paradox of solitude. Look long and hard enough at yourself in isolation and suddenly you will see the rest of humanity staring back.

There are other lives to consider: avocets, stilts, and stones. Peace is the perspective found in patterns.

In it, an epoch before Ursula K. Le Guin so brilliantly <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2014/10/17/ursula-k-le-guin-gender/\">unsexed <em>man</em> as the universal pronoun</a>, he writes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Solitude is the path over which destiny endeavors to lead man to himself. Solitude is the path that men most fear. A path fraught with terrors, where snakes and toads lie in wait… Without solitude there is no suffering, without solitude there is no heroism. But the solitude I have in mind is not the solitude of the blithe poets or of the theater, where the fountain bubbles so sweetly at the mouth of the hermit’s cave.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Learning to be nourished by solitude rather than defeated by it, Hesse argues, is a prerequisite for taking charge of our destiny: </p>\n<blockquote><p>Most men, the herd, have never tasted solitude. They leave father and mother, but only to crawl to a wife and quietly succumb to new warmth and new ties. They are never alone, they never commune with themselves… It is easier and sweeter to walk with a people, with a multitude — even through misery.
