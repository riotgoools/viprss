{"title":"It&#8217;s Eclipse Day!","link":"https://kottke.org/24/04/its-eclipse-day","date":1712582578000,"content":"\n        <p>Hey, gang. Today is the solar eclipse, itâ€™s supposed to be mostly sunny here in Colchester, VT, weâ€™ve got 3 minutes and 16 seconds of totality to enjoy, and I built a solar filter for my telescope (and binoculars!), so kottke.org is going to take the day off. Edith and I will see you back here tomorrow.</p>\n\n<p>In the meantime, are you doing anything for the eclipse? Anyone got any crazy camera/telescope setups? Do you think Instagram is going to crash this afternoon? Will I completely lose my mind if a cloud drifts in front of the sun tomorrow at 3:26pm ET? Is it a coincidence or a miracle that we happen to be alive during the relatively brief period of time when the moon almost exactly covers the sun, resulting in total solar eclipses? Could you imagine if the eclipse somehow <em>doesnâ€™t</em> happen tomorrow??!</p>\n\n <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/2024%20solar%20eclipse\">2024 solar eclipse</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/astronomy\">astronomy</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/kottke.org\">kottke.org</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Sun\">Sun</a></p>\n\n <p>ðŸ’¬ <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/04/its-eclipse-day\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> â†’</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"9f584ad9c2b752731d9ca95dcd37c8f68fc5f12685287df7a9fd493b451001f7","category":"default"}
