For years they have lived underground, soft milky-white nymphs nursed by endosymbiotic bacteria through their long helpless infancy. And then, as if by some divine signal, when the soil temperature reaches exactly 17.9 °C (64 °F), an obsidian exoskeleton encases their bodies in a flash to accompany them through the brief weeks of maturity as they rise from the underworld in singing search of a mate. </p>\n<p>In consonance with pioneering astronomer Maria Mitchell’s insistence that <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2017/06/05/maria-mitchell-science-religion/\">“every formula which expresses a law of nature is a hymn of praise to God,”</a> we now have a formula for predicting when this massive music festival of yearning will begin: <em>E</em> = (19.465 – <em>t</em>)/0.5136, where <em>E</em> denotes the emergence start date in May and <em>t</em> is the average April temperatures in Celsius.</p>\n<p>By early June, they have all emerged, more of them than all the humans who have ever lived; by late July, they have all died.</p>\n<figure><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/transformation-of-cicada-septemdecim-by-lillie-sullivan-1898-benefitting-the-nature-conservancy_print?curator=brainpicker\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/cicada_transformation_TheMarginalian.jpg?resize=680%2C1066&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"680\" height=\"1066\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/cicada_transformation_TheMarginalian.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/cicada_transformation_TheMarginalian.jpg?resize=320%2C502&amp;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/cicada_transformation_TheMarginalian.jpg?resize=600%2C941&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/cicada_transformation_TheMarginalian.jpg?resize=240%2C376&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/cicada_transformation_TheMarginalian.jpg?resize=768%2C1204&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/cicada_transformation_TheMarginalian.jpg?resize=979%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 979w\" /></a><figcaption>Transformation of the periodical <em>Cicada Septemdecim</em>.

On each side of the hollow abdomen is a tymbal — a mesh of miniature ribs woven into a hard membrane, strummed whenever the singer flexes his synchronous flight muscles. Unlike locusts, which make sound by rubbing their legs against their wings and with which they were long conflated — it was only in the tenth edition of his <em>Systema Naturae</em> that Linnaeus named the cicada as a different insect — cicadas sing the way humans do: with their whole body. </p>\n<figure><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/art-from-a-monograph-of-oriental-cicadidae-by-william-lucas-distant-1889-benefitting-the-nature-conservancy_print?curator=brainpicker\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/orientalcicada_TheMarginalian.jpg?resize=680%2C895&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"680\" height=\"895\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/orientalcicada_TheMarginalian.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/orientalcicada_TheMarginalian.jpg?resize=320%2C421&amp;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/orientalcicada_TheMarginalian.jpg?resize=600%2C790&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/orientalcicada_TheMarginalian.jpg?resize=240%2C316&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/orientalcicada_TheMarginalian.jpg?resize=768%2C1011&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/orientalcicada_TheMarginalian.jpg?resize=1167%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 1167w\" /></a><figcaption>Art from <em>A Monograph of Oriental Cicadidæ</em> by William Lucas Distant, 1889.

The Greeks considered it almost divine. When Pythagoras <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2021/03/02/pythagoras-sappho-music/\">discovered the mathematics of harmony</a>, a cicada sitting on a harp came to symbolize the science of music. Homer’s highest praise for orators was to compare them to cicadas. Anacreon, celebrated as the finest lyric poet of his civilization, reverenced them in verse:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Sweet prophet of summer, loved of the Muses,<br />\nBeloved of Phoebus who gave thee thy shrill song,<br />\nOld age does not wear upon thee;<br />\nThou art earth-born, musical, impassive, without blood.<br />\nThou art almost a god.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Epochs later, Lord Byron — poet laureate of the grandiose, otherwise blind to the grandeur of smallness — rhapsodized about these tiny “people of the pine” that “make their summer lives one ceaseless song.”</p>\n<p>But no one has written more poetically about the biological reality of the cicada than the artist, naturalist, philosopher, entomologist, and educator <strong>Anna Botsford Comstock</strong> (September 1, 1854–August 24, 1930) — the forgotten pioneer who planted the seed for the youth climate action movement by introducing nature study to school curricula at the dawn of the twentieth century, <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2021/10/18/anna-bostford-comstock-handbook-of-nature-study/\">making wonder a public good</a>.</p>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/AnnaBotsfordComstock_1900_dandelion.jpg?resize=680%2C1065&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"680\" height=\"1065\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/AnnaBotsfordComstock_1900_dandelion.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/AnnaBotsfordComstock_1900_dandelion.jpg?resize=320%2C501&amp;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/AnnaBotsfordComstock_1900_dandelion.jpg?resize=600%2C940&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/AnnaBotsfordComstock_1900_dandelion.jpg?resize=240%2C376&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/AnnaBotsfordComstock_1900_dandelion.jpg?resize=768%2C1203&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/AnnaBotsfordComstock_1900_dandelion.jpg?resize=981%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 981w\" /><figcaption>Anna Botsford Comstock circa 1900</figcaption></figure>\n<p>In 1903, Comstock wrote and illustrated <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Ways-Six-footed-Anna-Botsford-Comstock/dp/1376812053/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>Ways of the Six-Footed</em></strong></a> (<a href=\"https://search.worldcat.org/title/3073392\" target=\"_blank\"><em>public library</em></a> | <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/cu31924024557526\" target=\"_blank\"><em>public domain</em></a>) — a lyrical field guide to the world of insects, doing for entomology what Carl Sagan would do for astronomy two generations later. Celebrating the commonest male cicada of summer as the greatest of “the insect troubadours,” Comstock writes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>This musician… is an interesting-looking fellow, with a stout body and broad, transparent wings quite ornately veined… The cicada whose song is the most familiar to us is the “dog-day harvest-fly” or “Lyreman.” It resembles the seventeen-year species, except that it is larger and requires only two or three years in the immature state, below ground, instead of seventeen. The Lyreman when seen from above is black, with dull-green scroll ornamentation; below he is covered with white powder. He lives in trees; hidden beneath the leaves, this arboreal wooer sends forth a high trill, which seems to steep the senses of the listener in the essence of summer noons. If you chance to find a Lyreman fallen from his perch and take him in your hand, he will sing and you can feel his body vibrate with the sound. But it will remain a mystery where the musical instrument is situated, for it is nowhere visible to the uninitiated. However, if you place him on his back, you may see directly behind the base of each hind leg a circular plate, nearly a quarter of an inch in diameter; beneath each of these plates is a cavity across which is stretched a partition made up of three distinct kinds of membranes for the modulation of the tone; at the top of each cavity is a stiff, folded membrane which acts as a drumhead; but it is set In vibration by muscles instead of drumsticks, and these muscles move so rapidly that we cannot distinguish the separate vibrations. Thus, our Lyreman is provided with a very complicated pair of kettledrums, which he plays with so much skill that his music sounds more like that of a mandolin than of a drum. </p>\n<p>[…]</p>\n<p>Surely a new interest attaches to this summer-day song when we realize that it has pleased the human ear since the dim age of Homer. The cicada’s kettledrums are perhaps the only musical instruments now in use that have remained unchanged through a thousand centuries since they were first mentioned.</p></blockquote>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/cicada_dorbigny.jpg?resize=680%2C486&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"680\" height=\"486\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/cicada_dorbigny.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/cicada_dorbigny.jpg?resize=320%2C229&amp;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/cicada_dorbigny.jpg?resize=600%2C429&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/cicada_dorbigny.jpg?resize=240%2C171&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/cicada_dorbigny.jpg?resize=768%2C548&amp;ssl=1 768w\" /><figcaption><em>Cicada speciosa</em> by Charles Dessalines d’Orbigny, 1861.
