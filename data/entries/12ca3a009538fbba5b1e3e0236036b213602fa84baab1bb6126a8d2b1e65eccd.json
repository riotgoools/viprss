The Brazilian judiciary’s dispute with Elon Musk is just the latest example of a broader effort to restrict the ability of sovereign nations to define a digital development agenda free from the control of mega-corporations based in the United States. At the end of August, the Brazilian Supreme Federal Court banned the X platform from Brazilian cyberspace for failing to comply with court decisions that required the suspension of accounts that instigated right-wing extremists to participate in riots and occupy the Legislative, Judicial, and Governmental palaces on January 8, 2023. Subsequently, President Lula da Silva made clear the Brazilian government’s intention to seek digital independence: to reduce the country’s dependence on foreign entities for data, AI capabilities, and digital infrastructure, as well as to promote the development of local technological ecosystems. In line with these objectives, the Brazilian state also intends to force Big Tech to pay fair taxes, comply with local laws, and be held accountable for the social externalities of their business models, which often promote violence and inequality.</p>\r\n<p>These efforts have been met with attacks from the owner of X and right-wing leaders who complain about democracy and freedom of expression. But precisely because digital space lacks internationally and democratically decided regulatory agreements, large technology companies operate as rulers, deciding what should be moderated and what should be promoted on their platforms. Moreover, the X platform and other companies have begun to organize, along with their allies inside and outside the country, to undermine initiatives aimed at Brazil’s technological autonomy. More than a warning to Brazil, their actions send a worrying message to the world: that democratic countries seeking independence from Big Tech domination risk suffering disruptions to their democracies, with some Big Tech companies supporting far-right movements and parties.</p>\r\n<p>The Brazilian case has become the main front in the evolving global conflict between digital corporations and those seeking to build a democratic and people-centered digital landscape focused on social and economic development. Technology companies not only control the digital world, but also lobby and operate against the public sector’s ability to create and maintain an independent digital agenda based on local values, needs, and aspirations. When their financial interests are at stake, they work happily with authoritarian governments. What we need is sufficient digital space for states to direct technologies by putting people and the planet ahead of private profits or unilateral state control.</p>\r\n<p>All those who defend democratic values must support Brazil in its quest for digital sovereignty. We demand that Big Tech cease their attempts to sabotage Brazil’s initiatives aimed at building independent capabilities in artificial intelligence, public digital infrastructure, data governance, and cloud services. These attacks undermine not only the rights of Brazilian citizens but the broader aspirations of all democratic nations to achieve technological sovereignty. We also call on the Brazilian government to be firm in implementing its digital agenda and to denounce the pressures against it. The UN system and governments around the world should support these efforts.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Signed by Acemoglu, Zucman, Varoufakis, Cory Doctorow, Morozov, Mazzucato, Piketty, and many others.  Somehow no one is talking about this petition and its embrace of censorship?</p>\r\n<p>Via Pedro.  And you will find some media coverage in Portuguese <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.google.com/search?q=N%C3%B3s%2C+os+abaixo-assinados%2C+desejamos+expressar+nossa+profunda+preocupa%C3%A7%C3%A3o+com+os+ataques+em+andamento+por+parte+das+Big+Techs+e+seus+aliados+contra+a+soberania+digital+do+Brasil.&amp;sca_esv=ea82e60a3593f99e&amp;sca_upv=1&amp;source=hp&amp;ei=MynqZuSqGIWs5NoPqtGGsQk&amp;iflsig=AL9hbdgAAAAAZuo3Q1_DqRgEoXlJHbLZqBQoDfe3gBQG&amp;ved=0ahUKEwikkLKZqMuIAxUFFlkFHaqoIZYQ4dUDCBk&amp;uact=5&amp;oq=N%C3%B3s%2C+os+abaixo-assinados%2C+desejamos+expressar+nossa+profunda+preocupa%C3%A7%C3%A3o+com+os+ataques+em+andamento+por+parte+das+Big+Techs+e+seus+aliados+contra+a+soberania+digital+do+Brasil.&amp;gs_lp=Egdnd3Mtd2l6IrQBTsOzcywgb3MgYWJhaXhvLWFzc2luYWRvcywgZGVzZWphbW9zIGV4cHJlc3NhciBub3NzYSBwcm9mdW5kYSBwcmVvY3VwYcOnw6NvIGNvbSBvcyBhdGFxdWVzIGVtIGFuZGFtZW50byBwb3IgcGFydGUgZGFzIEJpZyBUZWNocyBlIHNldXMgYWxpYWRvcyBjb250cmEgYSBzb2JlcmFuaWEgZGlnaXRhbCBkbyBCcmFzaWwuSABQAFgAcAB4AJABAJgBAKABAKoBALgBA8gBAPgBAvgBAZgCAKACAJgDAJIHAKAHAA&amp;sclient=gws-wiz\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\r\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/09/scholars-in-support-of-the-moraes-brazil-decision-against-x.html\">Scholars in support of the Moraes Brazil decision against X</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com\">Marginal REVOLUTION</a>.</p>\r\n<img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/904799093/0/marginalrevolution\" />\r\n<div><a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/904799093/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/904799093/marginalrevolution,\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/904799093/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/x.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/904799093/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/904799093/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/09/scholars-in-support-of-the-moraes-brazil-decision-against-x.html#comments\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/comments20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/09/scholars-in-support-of-the-moraes-brazil-decision-against-x.html/feed\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/commentsrss20.png\" /></a> \r\n<div><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/09/scholars-in-support-of-the-moraes-brazil-decision-against-x.html#comments\"><h3>Comments</h3></a><ul><li><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/09/scholars-in-support-of-the-moraes-brazil-decision-against-x.html#comment-160813628\">Tyler’s naivete never ceases to amaze.
