This must go back at least as far as the 2016 election and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton_email_controversy\">Hillary’s emails</a>. The editorial people broke the wall, deciding to give the readers <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/media/2024/10/25/washington-post-endorsement-president/\">the first glimpse</a> we’ve gotten into the inner conflicts of one two most influential news orgs in the country.\n</p>\n<p>Until now this was the one story they would never report on. Truly a milestone. And now that the window is open, open it further. Report on how a major news org holds back stories that would be of intense interest to the people, if only the news orgs did their jobs.
