{"title":"On Tesla, Nazis, X and the Macintosh of cars","link":"http://scripting.com/2024/04/09/160339.html?title=onTeslaNazisXAndTheMacintoshOfCars","date":1712678619000,"content":"<p>I'm not sure I'd buy a Tesla today because of Musk's politics which he puts in our face, thus influencing other people to inflict their nightmares on us. I bet in the end Musk will be responsible for a lot of people dying. </p>\n<p>On the other hand, I love the car, and thus love the people who developed it, who I don't know. I hope they're not Nazis. I don't see how someone who could design such a thing as a Tesla Model Y, in <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2021/11/19/140204.html?title=myNewTesla\">2021</a>, the year I bought mine, could be anything like that. </p>\n<p>This car is going to be copied. There will be a generation of cars that comes along, some that have not arrived yet, that will have to stand up to a comparison to a Tesla. This is the original. </p>\n<p>To be alive when such a product comes out and not own one, that would be hard for me to do. I don't think my \"support\" of Tesla could mean that much. The money is already spent. It costs nothing to maintain the car (one of its innovations). </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/04/09/word.png\" />It's like the Macintosh of cars. I would have owned a Macintosh in 1984 even if I wasn't one of Apple's top developers. I also know that Steve Jobs didn't design the machine, he stole it from people at Xerox who did. Apple refined the idea, made it practical, like a Tesla, commercial. That's a huge accomplishment, commercializing and humanizing a concept like the Mac was harder than inventing, imho. I have a feeling that Tesla must stand on the shoulders of giants in a similar way. </p>\n<p>Tesla is always sending me emails, which I usually read, but last week I got one urging me to join X. I thought what bullshit. I don't want these products connected. There was a time, not that long ago, that I would have thought a car hooked up to Twitter as a fantastic and futuristic idea, but now, I think it means no one of principle, certainly no one who is a target of Nazis could work at Tesla in the future. And those are some of the brightest people out there. </p>\n<p>Meanwhile I'm looking at other company's EVs with lust. I might like a Kia or a BMW. If you're making a consumer product, Nazi branding is not a good look. And X is becoming a stinker too. </p>\n<p>PS: I was inspired to write this piece by one written by <a href=\"https://werd.io/\">Ben Wurdmuller</a> <a href=\"https://werd.io/2024/i-tried-tesla-fsd\">posted yesterday</a>. I've had much the same feeling about <a href=\"https://www.tesla.com/ownersmanual/modely/en_us/GUID-2CB60804-9CEA-4F4B-8B04-09B991368DC5.html\">FSD</a>. This piece started out to be about FSD, but the preamble, like the one in his piece, got so long I decided to post it first as its own piece. </p>","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"a3ca9a807c319ca4d5b8ab7b21bdd1ef1a2e0a49be2cdf71cf5ff59554190e70","category":"default"}
