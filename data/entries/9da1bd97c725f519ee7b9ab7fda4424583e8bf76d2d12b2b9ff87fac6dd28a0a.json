{"title":"One of YouTube's biggest channels is opening a massive production studio","link":"https://www.usermag.co/p/one-of-youtubes-biggest-channels","date":1732194366000,"content":"<p>Today, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@AlanChikinChow\">Alan Chikin Chow</a>, a top Gen Z creator who is known for his <em>Alan's Universe</em> YouTube series, is opening a sprawling new 10,000-square-foot production studio in Los Angeles. The studio's opening is just the latest big example of a creator-led media company institutionalizing and competing directly with Hollywood studios.  </p><p>With 10 custom-built sets, professional-grade cameras, and upgraded lighting, the studio will serve as a home for all of Alan's content production across YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram. </p><p>I've been fascinated by Alan's career for a while. Over the past couple years, the former USC acting student has seen a meteoric rise, powered primarily by his mega-viral K-drama-inspired series <em>Alan’s Universe</em>. </p><div><div></div></div><p>The numbers Alan is putting up are staggering: <em>Alan’s Universe</em> averages over 20 million views per episode on YouTube. The series alone has amassed over 500 million views, and Alan's overall YouTube channel reaches a monthly viewership of 1-2 billion. </p><p>Alan’s reach surpasses many of the most established YouTube giants. He currently has nearly 70 million subscribers on his primary channel, placing him among the top 40 most-followed YouTube channels worldwide. </p><p>Alan produces content aimed at a tween audience. His YouTube drama series, <em>Alan’s Universe</em>, is Korean drama meets <em>Riverdale</em> for a younger audience. With bright pink lockers, theatrical costumes, and triumphant storylines, the series is designed to appeal to the channel's core 7-to-14-year-old audience. </p><p>Alan's aim was to capture the market of kids who might have turned to Disney Channel or Nickelodeon a decade ago, but now flock to YouTube for their entertainment. He is especially focused on appealing to young girls. </p><p>“We’re serving an audience that doesn’t really have this kind of content anymore,” Chow said. “There’s a lot of boy content out there—MrBeast, IShowSpeed, Kai Cenat—but we’re creating something for the girls, the ones who love K-pop and dream about fantasy worlds.”</p><p>Behind the scenes, Alan oversees a team of 20 people. His ambition extends far beyond digital platforms. He envisions <em>Alan’s Universe</em> as a multi-platform franchise encompassing film, TV, live music, and touring. “We’re building something that can exist everywhere,” he says. “I want this to be a brand that resonates globally.”</p><div><figure><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0bd71dec-47cd-4b52-99fe-0b255a62118c_1608x928.png\"><div><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0bd71dec-47cd-4b52-99fe-0b255a62118c_1608x928.png\" width=\"1456\" height=\"840\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0bd71dec-47cd-4b52-99fe-0b255a62118c_1608x928.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0bd71dec-47cd-4b52-99fe-0b255a62118c_1608x928.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0bd71dec-47cd-4b52-99fe-0b255a62118c_1608x928.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0bd71dec-47cd-4b52-99fe-0b255a62118c_1608x928.png 1456w\" loading=\"lazy\" /><div></div></div></a><figcaption>Alan’s The 10,000 sq-ft. space will feature 10+ originally built sets</figcaption></figure></div><div><figure><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37f512dd-724c-42cf-856b-f6414ae32648_1551x924.png\"><div><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37f512dd-724c-42cf-856b-f6414ae32648_1551x924.png\" width=\"1456\" height=\"867\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37f512dd-724c-42cf-856b-f6414ae32648_1551x924.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37f512dd-724c-42cf-856b-f6414ae32648_1551x924.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37f512dd-724c-42cf-856b-f6414ae32648_1551x924.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37f512dd-724c-42cf-856b-f6414ae32648_1551x924.png 1456w\" loading=\"lazy\" /><div></div></div></a><figcaption>The original sets reflect the unique “Alan’s Universe” K-drama-inspired aesthetic with particular emphasis on colors, decorations, and set design.</figcaption></figure></div><p><em>Alan's Universe</em> is taking off at a time when younger audiences are primarily consuming entertainment on platforms like YouTube and TikTok, often seeking out authenticity and relatability over more polished, traditional scripted content. What’s made Alan exceptionally successful is his unique blend: he leverages the parasocial bonds afforded by digital platforms while following the principles of traditional storytelling </p><p>Though some aspects of the show are similar to scripted series you might find on Netflix or Disney+, Alan said that their story development process and distribution strategy are radically different. </p><p><em>Alan's Universe</em> was born, in part, after Alan noticed movie clips taking off on YouTube Shorts. Instead of being presented as straight clips of movies, many viral movie Shorts were presented as their own standalone mini stories. Many young people who watched the old movie clips didn’t even realize what they were watching was from a feature-length movie. They thought the scenes were simply little films made for YouTube Shorts. </p><p><a href=\"https://www.usermag.co/subscribe?\"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p>Alan was inspired by this and decided to build <em>Alan's Universe</em> out in a way that felt native to short-form video. He constantly monitors what types of stories, themes, and narrative arcs are performing well on YouTube Shorts. For instance, he keeps track of what scenes are getting clipped from the most from popular K dramas. He then takes the storylines or themes of those scenes and adapts them into <em>Alan's Universe</em>. </p><p>Instead of publishing a longform <em>Alan's Universe</em> episode then grabbing clips to promote it, Alan and his team produce entirely separate storylines specifically for YouTube Shorts. This way, each YouTube Short can be consumed alone as its own story (though each Short does tie into a broader theme related to the longer episode). </p><p>\"Shorts are always uniquely made to be Shorts,\" he added. \"This is something I fought with everyone about. Everyone has told me, just make cut downs of the long form episode. But I have been a top Shorts creator since before I even made the show. I know how to make Shorts very, very specifically, and I know how to make them go viral.\"</p><div><div></div></div><p>Chow’s journey to becoming one of YouTube’s most powerful creators started in 2019. After growing up in Dallas then moving to Los Angeles to attend college at USC, he began making videos as a way to connect with his parents, who moved to a small town in West Virginia in 2019. “I started making videos just to make my mom laugh,” he said. </p><p>He began with lighthearted comedy and viral content. That changed in 2022 when he experienced a health crisis. “I had gone through multiple surgeries and was in a really dark place,” he said. “I wanted to create something that inspired people, with magic, music, and fantasy—something that could give others the same sense of hope I was seeking.\"</p><p>The result was <em>Alan’s Universe. </em>After scripting out the show, creating a pilot, and getting some traction, Alan hired five of his close friends to star in the series. They're all either former USC acting students or influencers. Since <em>Alan's Universe</em> launched about a year ago, the group has been shooting all of their content on a shoestring budget. \"We shot the majority of the series in a literally 800-square-foot apartment,\" he said.</p><p>Now, riding on the success of <em>Alan's Universe</em>, Alan wants to build out a full-fledged Hollywood-style production operation. “There’s a big democratization of how content is made,” he said. “All the power doesn’t rely on a few decision-makers anymore. Anyone with a strong voice and the know-how can create something that gets seen.”</p><p>As Hollywood grapples with declining box office numbers and traditional TV loses ground to streaming, Alan hopes he can build out the <em>Alan's Universe</em> franchise across the online world. </p><p>“YouTube is now the number one streaming service in terms of watch time, according to Nielsen,” he said. “That’s a huge indicator of how things are shifting.”</p><div><div><div><p>User Mag is a 100% reader-supported publication.

Instead of Logan Paul, a lookalike arrived and sat down in front of our reporter, Matt Shea, and began impersonating the YouTuber.</p><p>We called him out and began complaining to Paul’s assistant, asking whether the real Logan Paul would be coming.
