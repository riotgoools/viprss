Iâ€™m gonna be on vacation with my family for the rest of the week, so I wonâ€™t be posting here that much, if at all. September is going to be busy â€” kids back to school, Ollie applying to college, mtn biking â€” so Iâ€™m gonna recharge the olâ€™ batts at the beach.</p>\n\n<p>Even though next month will be hectic, Iâ€™m looking forward to getting back to mucking about with the guts of the site after taking the summer off from that. Iâ€™ve got some rough ideas about improvements for the comments section, adding social features, and a few other things.</p>\n\n<p>Catch you back here next Tuesday!</p>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/kottke.org\">kottke.org</a></p>\n\n         <p>ðŸ’¬ <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/08/taking-some-time\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> â†’</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"3a52180957a66213bfb5e4f85d153f0d46d5f5fab527e54a18350696e71fa672","category":"default"}
