It opens this Friday, April 26, at <a href=\"https://www.ifccenter.com/films/the-feeling-that-the-time-for-doing-something-has-passed/#\">IFC</a> and <a href=\"https://www.filmlinc.org/films/the-feeling-that-the-time-for-doing-something-has-passed/\">Lincoln Center</a> in NYC. I don’t know if I’m going to watch it, but I couldn’t really look away. </p>\n\n<p>Arnow also stars as… </p>\n\n<blockquote><p>an emotionally detached young Brooklynite drifting through unremarkable days and nights. Neither her on-again-off-again BDSM relationship with a mildly disinterested older dom, nor her nondescript corporate job, appear to bring her any satisfaction.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>And yet “she finds a core of poignant truth about the ways people search for … emotional happiness and sexual gratification” (per the Lincoln Center <a href=\"https://www.filmlinc.org/films/the-feeling-that-the-time-for-doing-something-has-passed/\">summary</a>). It’s currently at a <a href=\"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_feeling_that_the_time_for_doing_something_has_passed\">100%</a> on Rotten Tomatoes, FWIW.
