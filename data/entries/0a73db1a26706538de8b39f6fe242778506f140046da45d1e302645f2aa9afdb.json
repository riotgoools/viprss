Aimed at kids aged 7-12, the new version includes a selection of contemporary artists alongside familiar favorites.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>This single volume features 60 artists through a wide range of large-scale, full-page reproductions of their artworks, including paintings, photographs, sculptures, video, prints, and installations from across time and space. Each page showcases defining artworks by the artists, combined with an interactive and informative conversation, giving relatable and memorable contexts for children, and inspiring a curiosity and appreciation for the Visual Arts that will continue into adulthood.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Iâ€™ve grown to love art as an adult but I donâ€™t remember ever noticing or caring about any art when I was a kid. If this book had dropped into the lap of a young Jason, I wonder if it would have sparked anything?</p>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/art\">art</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/books\">books</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/The%20Art%20Book%20for%20Children\">The Art Book for Children</a></p>\n\n         <p>ðŸ’¬ <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/06/the-art-book-for-children\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> â†’</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"0a73db1a26706538de8b39f6fe242778506f140046da45d1e302645f2aa9afdb","category":"default"}
