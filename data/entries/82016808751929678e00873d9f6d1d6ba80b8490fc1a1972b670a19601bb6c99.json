And it seems as if they have settled on two core ideas. First, they need their <a href=\"https://www.garbageday.email/p/where-is-the-lib-joe-rogan?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=the-internet-s-most-vocal-freaks\" target=\"_blank\">own Joe Rogan</a>. Which is wrong, of course. And, second, they’ve decided they probably don’t care about trans people anymore.</p><p>Rep. Seth Moulton (D-MA) spoke to the centrist TERFs over at <i><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/16/us/politics/democrats-transgender-rights-moulton.html?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=the-internet-s-most-vocal-freaks\" target=\"_blank\">The New York Times</a></i> last week, coming out against trans children in sports. “I have two little girls. I don’t want them getting run over on a playing field by a male or formerly male athlete,” he said. (What if your girls are just bad at sports, Seth?)</p><p>Moulton got <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/4996259-democratic-transgender-rights-election/?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=the-internet-s-most-vocal-freaks\" target=\"_blank\">some flack</a> from Democratic leadership about his anti-trans comments, but he’s not the only Democrat <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/06/nyregion/democrats-house-ny.html?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=the-internet-s-most-vocal-freaks\" target=\"_blank\">getting louder</a> about this stuff. I mean, the Harris campaign was already <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/kamala-harris-trans-rights-platform/?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=the-internet-s-most-vocal-freaks\" target=\"_blank\">not really doing much</a> for trans voters. And I think it’s safe to assume that, at the very least, Democrats are going to go very quiet on the trans issue as they start gearing up for 2026 and elections beyond. But before we go further into why the Democrats seem so eager to jettison trans rights from their platform, we have to look at what voters actually care about right now (SPOILER: It’s not trans people).</p><p>Data is still coming in about what really moved the needle during the election, but, at this point, it seems like the economy was the number one issue. <i>Pew</i> had it at the top <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/09/09/issues-and-the-2024-election/?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=the-internet-s-most-vocal-freaks\" target=\"_blank\">of a survey</a> they conducted in September. As did <i>Gallup</i> <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/651719/economy-important-issue-2024-presidential-vote.aspx?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=the-internet-s-most-vocal-freaks\" target=\"_blank\">in a poll</a> taken around the same time. <i>Pew</i> didn’t even have transgender rights ranking high enough to include, while <i>Gallup</i> had it dead last on their list, with the majority of voters calling it unimportant. Now, Republicans can’t really say much about the economy other than “no more taxes” or whatever because they plan to spend the next four(?) years shoveling money at the various oligarchs they work for. And Democrats can’t either because, well, uh, they’re <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/silicon-valley-billionaires-investors-kamala-harris-mark-cuban-reid-hoffman-2024-8?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=the-internet-s-most-vocal-freaks\" target=\"_blank\">working for</a> the same oligarchs, apparently. Which may explain why both parties want to distract us with endless discourse about <a href=\"https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/Trans-Pop-Update-Jun-2022.pdf?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=the-internet-s-most-vocal-freaks\" target=\"_blank\">0.6%</a> of the population instead, you know, student loan forgiveness or something. </p><p>But there’s another point here that is important to hit — one that connects the Democrat’s recent fetishization of Joe Rogan and their growing ambivalence about the horrors the Republican Party has in store for America’s trans community. Democrats, after crashing out on Brat Summer, are desperate not to <i>be</i> relevant, but <i>feel</i> relevant, and transphobia plays real well on social media. If we accept the idea that one of the main forces that drove Elon Musk to buy Twitter <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2024/07/22/elon-musk-jordan-peterson-interview/74506785007/?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=the-internet-s-most-vocal-freaks\" target=\"_blank\">was resentment</a> over his daughter coming out as trans — and I do, because I find the pettiest, dumbest reasons are usually the closest to the truth — then it’s reasonable to view Musk’s entire X project as one to, as he has often put it, defeat “the woke mind virus.” He can dress it up however he wants, by claiming he’s actually defending free speech or<a href=\"https://slate.com/technology/2023/10/elon-musk-grimes-babies-pronatalism-research.html?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=the-internet-s-most-vocal-freaks\" target=\"_blank\"> protecting birthrates</a>. But the heart of Twitter’s transition to X is about demonizing trans people for, as we’ve seen by his installation inside the palace court of Mar-A-Lago this month, political gain. And I think that Democrats, unable to accept hard truths about how badly they missed the mark, are, frankly, jealous. </p><div><img src=\"https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/1c65cb73-2fb2-4a92-bc18-78273887708f/Screenshot_2024-11-20_at_1.17.30_PM.png?t=1732126663\" /><div><span><p>(Nice work Nancy, this video really sells the “trans people are weird and I am normal” line.)</p></span></div></div><p>Republicans are <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/11/19/nx-s1-5196116/capitol-transgender-bathroom-ban-nancy-mace-sarah-mcbride?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=the-internet-s-most-vocal-freaks\" target=\"_blank\">already launching</a> anti-trans political stunts, like the measure from Rep. Nancy Mace (R-SC) this week that would ban transgender women — specifically trans Democratic Rep.-elect Sarah McBride — from women’s bathrooms in the Capitol Building. And Republican representatives <a href=\"https://x.com/RepMikeCollins/status/1859226440702534109?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=the-internet-s-most-vocal-freaks\" target=\"_blank\">are celebrating</a> Trans Day Of Remembrance by posting “‘Transgender women’ are men,” to the frothing applause of X losers. Because in a fractured information environment, where traditional news barely exists and content created to enrage the internet’s most vocal freaks has replaced it, Republicans have smartly realized that nothing matters if it can’t be screenshot or clipped. They are clearly going to push some ridiculous anti-trans or anti-immigrant measure every week for the next four years, regardless of who gets hurt in the process or whether voters actually even care.</p><p>And the really frustrating thing is that Democrats could just as easily use this playbook against them to actually support trans people and, of course, America’s greater LGBT population that are absolutely next on the chopping block. I mean, Democrats that actually did do well this election <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/12/opinion/democratic-party-future-kentucky.html?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=the-internet-s-most-vocal-freaks\" target=\"_blank\">have even said</a> that being pro-trans helped them quite a bit at the polls. Liberal politicians could delete their X accounts, set up shop on platforms like Bluesky or the probably-no-longer-banned TikTok and start loudly screaming about how weird the right’s obsession with trans people is. Because social media discourse is headless, the algorithms that promote it just want conflict, and Democrats still don’t get that. If you want attention you actually have to pick a fight — or even just pick something you’re willing to fight for.</p><hr /><h2>Did Tumblr actually turn teens trans?</h2><div><img src=\"https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/b9d7b271-6aa4-46c8-9c9a-3563a96a02e7/pwvera.png?t=1732129082\" /></div><p>This week’s episode is, sadly, a lot more relevant than it was when we recorded it a few weeks ago.

When we asked her to come on to debunk the right-wing conspiracy theory that Tumblr turned a generation of kids trans, Vera said she’d be up for being a guest on the one condition that she could argue that, yes, Tumblr probably did help her realize she was trans.

It has significantly increased this week. Far-right YouTuber The Quartering tried to make an account on the platform before he was <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/saltierthankrayt/comments/1gurujv/moments_before_being_suspended_on_bluesky/?share_id=ru3BHHhnvNchliPP8SPKj&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=22\" target=\"_blank\">suspended</a> yesterday. And former Kiwi Farms users have tried to create what appear to be blocklists as a way to trick people into automatically banning prominent trans users.</p><p>That last report comes from a non-profit called End Networked Harassment, who has responded to the fascist invasion of Bluesky by creating a <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/endharassment.net/post/3lb637ffty22e?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=the-internet-s-most-vocal-freaks\" target=\"_blank\">moderation list</a> that automatically filters any sort of content or terminology popular on Kiwi Farms. Though, making things even more confusing, now Kiwi Farms users <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/rahaeli.bsky.social/post/3lbba6qdins24?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=the-internet-s-most-vocal-freaks\" target=\"_blank\">are making</a> Kiwi Farms blocklists to muddy the waters.</p><p>This is going to be a really interesting space to watch over the next few months as Bluesky’s profile increases.

And the fact no one has replaced her in the chain is probably proof that TV is no longer the prism through which Americans are learning about the internet. Which actually leads to a slightly more uncomfortable conclusion.
