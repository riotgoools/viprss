honestly, i haven't felt like being on the internet much at all since the us election happened. i can't say i was surprised by the result (i foreshadowed it in my <a href=\"https://ellesho.me/page/website/now/#halloween-at-home\" target=\"_blank\">halloween post</a>.) but i was shocked, disgusted, and disappointed by it all the same. the days following nov 5 only confirmed my fears with the immediate increase of online (and offline) <a href=\"https://www.teenvogue.com/story/emboldened-by-a-trump-win-misogyny-is-exploding-online\" target=\"_blank\">misogyny</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/08/racist-text-messages-trump-win\" target=\"_blank\">racism</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/fbi-says-bigoted-text-messages-also-sent-lgbtq-hispanic-people-2024-11-15/\" target=\"_blank\">bigotry</a> because the worst people saw their guy winning as an approval. how will it escalate when things actually start for real in 2025?</p>\n          <p>it felt worse to me this time because of how much big internet money drove this result – from elon musk to <a href=\"https://archive.is/NvsSK\" target=\"_blank\">big tech ceos</a> to <a href=\"https://www.followthecrypto.org\" target=\"_blank\">crypto pacs</a>. i know special interest money is unfortunately always a part of it but what i saw full force in this election wasn't the internet where marginalized people can actually have a voice but an uneven space where, once again, entities with outsized capital and influence con and bully their way into controlling everyone's lives. seeing the internet in this way makes me feel so gross, like maybe it's a lost cause.</p>\n          <p>i've written before about how the web has been a refuge for me. growing up, i was an outsider. i grew up in a very conservative, religious, and conformist town that treated anyone outside their limited worldview with distain. i wanted no part in the mass culture that everyone defaulted to, wearing the same brands of clothing, consuming the same media, performing the same ascribed roles. it was on the internet that i found people to talk to about weird animes or learn how to play obscure songs or figure out fun html tricks. it was online where i could encounter more expansive ideas and truly escape the restrictive local culture. when i went online, a better alternative world came into focus.</p>\n          <p>i don't know if i can still say that with confidence. i mean, that open internet is still there but it's been displaced out of view. because now, when i go online, i can't avoid seeing all the terrible things of irl piling up everywhere, obscuring the little bits of good. it's less of a window into a more open world and more of a mirror or maybe even a funhouse mirror, taking the horrors of real life and stretching and distorting them even more and reflecting that image back onto us, <a href=\"https://www.animanoir.xyz/blog/2024/the-death-state-of-the-internet/\" target=\"_blank\">reshaping our very being</a>. and i feel like an outsider needing to find an alternative space again.</p>\n          <p>over the past couple weeks, i started building a links page/section here. it was on my todo list to make one but i was extra motivated after reading <a href=\"https://thoughts.melonking.net/thoughts/every-site-needs-a-links-page-why-linking-matters\" target=\"_blank\">this</a> and feeling like i need to do something to be a \"positive citizen of the web\" after recent events, even if it's just putting some hyperlinks on my page. i'm still collecting links to put on it. most of the sites i have so far are sites i've recently visited. there are two links sections<sup><a href=\"https://6chcl6xjikbnwusbdcwole44rjexv6q7t6nz7x7byk3zru7xbmbq.arweave.net/8I4l-ulCgttSQRis5ZOcikl6-h-fm5_f4cK3mNP3CwM\" target=\"_blank\">1</a></sup> – a <a href=\"https://ellesho.me/page/website/links\" target=\"_blank\">text link page</a> on the flat version of this homepage and an 88x31 button link popup menu on the <a href=\"https://ellesho.me/page\" target=\"_blank\">3d view</a> if you click on the nintendo ds/pokedex/handinavi thing on the ground.</p>\n          <p>i've been working on recentering myself. i've been disconnecting from social media to create more distance from those platforms so as not to have a direct pipeline to my brain for the poison that's surely on the way. i don't know what's going to happen from here but i'm just going to keep doing what i believe in and focusing on the people i care about. anyways, here are <a

future.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"elle's
