For the next sixty seconds this station will conduct a test of a new server app that combines the functionality of several apps I used to run as separate servers. The goal is to be able to integrate the functionality of all the components. It's time to invest in blogging in a real way. The 2017 corner-turn was about getting back to the foundation I had before trying to co-exist with Twitter, Facebook, Medium. All three are now no longer high value targets. So while I wasted a lot of time trying to peer with them, I did finally get off the horse and I had a decent setup while developed <a href=\"http://drummer.land/\">Drummer</a> and <a href=\"https://feedland.com/\">FeedLand</a> and in doing so learned how to do scalable server apps with SQL. I've wasted so much time trying to be compatible with apps that didn't want us. I have a feeling that none of the current targets really want us either. So let's get back to the Open Web, which gave us much hope before. I think we can do a lot with feeds and OPML. They're to open systems what GPL is to open source. You don't get to be half-committed to being open, you have to be all-in or you can't play. (Same idea as podcasting, which of course is just an instance of RSS.) You don't have to deal with a lot of confusion to find the interop. You just have to be willing to look in that direction. This started out as a test post and look what it has become.","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"cd4346099b7008842d92a53a245d828250573cd2c7fa4b330636d9503bbe5400","category":"Sites"}
