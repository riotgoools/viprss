For the latest installment of my newish <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Drawing%20Media\">illustrated column</a>, I interviewed my friend and neighbor, the artist and climate activist <a href=\"https://www.zariaforman.com/\">Zaria Forman</a>. Zaria makes pastel drawings of ice, among other things, and her solo show “<a href=\"https://newyork.winstonwachter.com/exhibitions/zaria-forman-fellsfjara-iceland/\">Fellsfjara, Iceland</a>” is currently on exhibition at Winston Wächter gallery in New York until May 4. (I’ve rendered a miniature version of some of it right below these words, but <a href=\"https://newyork.winstonwachter.com/exhibitions/zaria-forman-fellsfjara-iceland/\">definitely click here</a> for the actual images.) Zaria is also on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/zarialynn/\">Instagram</a>. </em></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/zariaice1.jpg\" srcset=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=500,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/zariaice1.jpg 500w, /cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/zariaice1.jpg 1200w\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"657\" alt=\"zariaice1.jpg\" /><br />\n<img src=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/zariaice2.jpg\" srcset=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=500,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/zariaice2.jpg 500w, /cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/zariaice2.jpg 1200w\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1891\" height=\"607\" alt=\"zariaice2.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p><strong>Zaria, have you read, watched, listened to, or otherwise experienced anything good recently?</strong><br />\n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/RlbR5N6veqw?si=HIWYCwyXo4CeAgEV\">Poor Things</a>. It was so visually stimulating and imaginative — more than anything I’ve seen in a while.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/zariapoorthings.jpg\" srcset=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=500,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/zariapoorthings.jpg 500w, /cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/zariapoorthings.jpg 1200w\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1003\" height=\"915\" alt=\"zariapoorthings.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>Possibly more interesting: the ice storm a few weekends ago! I’d never seen an ice storm before moving to upstate New York, and although the storms are destructive, they’re so beautiful. It was the most spectacular one I’ve ever experienced.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Seen anything bad?</strong><br />\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._%26_Mrs._Smith_(2024_TV_series)\">Mr. and Mrs. Smith</a>, the new version. I thought it was poorly cast and just plain dumb. OR: All the mud, now that the ice has melted ;)</p>\n\n<p><strong>What’s something you’ve read or seen that changed your life?</strong><br />\nSeeing glaciers and icebergs for the first time absolutely changed my life. But if we’re sticking to books, etc., one that changed my way of thinking was <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1611804787/ref=nosim/0sil8\">Love Between Equals: Relationship as a Spiritual Path</a>, by Polly Young-Eisendrath.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/zarialovebetweenequals.jpg\" srcset=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=500,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/zarialovebetweenequals.jpg 500w, /cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/zarialovebetweenequals.jpg 1200w\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"849\" height=\"1005\" alt=\"zarialovebetweenequals.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>She’s a psychologist and couples therapist, and the book just kind of reframed the idea of relationships in my mind — of how you relate to someone you’re in a long-term relationship with, and how you can grow with them. And how, like, love is.</p>\n\n<p>She talks about radical acceptance, fully accepting someone for who they are, learning how to do the same for yourself, and then figuring out how all of that can work together.</p>\n\n<p>Another one that changed my way of thinking was <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0061707813/ref=nosim/0sil8\">Sex at Dawn: How We Mate, Why We Stray, and What It Means for Modern Relationships</a>, by Christopher Ryan and Calcida Jetha.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Does anything make you laugh online?</strong> <br />\nMemes on Instagram!</p>\n\n<p><strong>What’s a recent one?</strong> <br />\nI just forwarded you <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/C3qzagBvueO/\">the last one I sent</a> to [my husband] this morning.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/zariawaffles1.jpg\" srcset=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=500,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/zariawaffles1.jpg 500w, /cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/zariawaffles1.jpg 1200w\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"924\" height=\"1013\" alt=\"zariawaffles1.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p><strong>Are there any cultural moments you currently think about unusually often? Like are you haunted by a moment from a TV show, or anything like that?</strong> <br />\nMore “inspired” than “haunted,” but the artists Ray and Charles Eames made a 10-minute documentary in 1977 called “<a href=\"https://youtu.be/0fKBhvDjuy0?si=a9ApHeRKhWTwkz7T\">Powers of 10</a>” that made a big impact on me. The Tang Teaching Museum in Saratoga Springs exhibited the film in a show during my years at Skidmore College, and it’s probably the one film I think about more than any other. </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/zariapowers1.jpg\" srcset=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=500,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/zariapowers1.jpg 500w, /cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/zariapowers1.jpg 1200w\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1044\" height=\"1365\" alt=\"zariapowers1.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p><strong>What’s it about?</strong><br />\nIt starts with a couple on a blanket having a picnic by a lake in Chicago. And then from one of their hands, the camera zooms back 10 meters. And then it continues zooming back by powers of ten. And so you see these squares get smaller and smaller, and it keeps going into the atmosphere, and the solar system, and it’s just mind-boggling how it keeps going.</p>\n\n<p>And then it then zooms back down to the picnic and goes into their skin and all the way down to, like, a molecule inside the body. And it’s crazy to see the similarities between the two.</p>\n\n<p>It’s on YouTube, if you want to watch — I highly recommend! </p>\n\n<p><strong>What were you really into when you were 12?</strong><br />\nMy So-Called Life, singing along to Alanis Morissette, and a boy named Ben. </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/zaria12.jpg\" srcset=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=500,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/zaria12.jpg 500w, /cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/zaria12.jpg 1200w\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2014\" height=\"572\" alt=\"zaria12.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p><strong>Is there a book/movie/whatever you’d like to experience again for the first time? </strong><br />\nBurning Man. There’s just no way to really know what it’s like until you’re there, in the middle of it. And when you know what to expect, it’s not as thrilling. But as a climate activist, it doesn’t feel right to continue attending over and over. </p>\n\n<p><strong>What’s a funny or weird way people have described your art?</strong><br />\nAs “finger painting.” It was a term used first (I think) in the Daily Mail, and then almost every writer used it to describe my work for several years. I wince at a line I say in my <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/zaria_forman_drawings_that_show_the_beauty_and_fragility_of_earth\">TedTalk</a>: “I cringe when people call me a finger painter,” or something like that — my tone just sounds so snobby, I hate it — but I was attempting to detach my work from the term, and it did finally work. It pops up every now and then, but rarely.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/zariafinger.jpg\" srcset=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=500,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/zariafinger.jpg 500w, /cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/zariafinger.jpg 1200w\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1159\" height=\"936\" alt=\"zariafinger.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p><strong>Please tell me something silly that you love.</strong> <br />\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naked_Attraction\">Naked Attraction</a>, the dating show where people are naked.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/zarianaked1.jpg\" srcset=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=500,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/zarianaked1.jpg 500w, /cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/zarianaked1.jpg 1200w\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1232\" height=\"672\" alt=\"zarianaked1.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p><strong>Thanks, Zaria! </strong></p>\n\n<p><em>Zaria’s work can be found <a href=\"https://www.zariaforman.com/\">here</a>.
