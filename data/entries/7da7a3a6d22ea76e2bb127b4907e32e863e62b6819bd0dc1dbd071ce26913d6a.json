{"title":"Deadly Precaution","link":"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/897844097/0/marginalrevolution~Deadly-Precaution.html","date":1716895289000,"content":"<p>MSNBC asked me to put together my thoughts on<a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/sunscreen-united-states-fda-ingredients-rcna153526\"> the FDA and sunscreen</a>. I think the piece came out very well. Here are some key grafs:</p>\r\n<blockquote><p>…In the European Union, sunscreens are regulated as <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://single-market-economy.ec.europa.eu/sectors/cosmetics/cosmetic-products-specific-topics/sunscreen-products_en\" target=\"_blank\">cosmetics</a>, which means greater flexibility in approving active ingredients. In the U.S., sunscreens are <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/nonprescription-sunscreen-drug-products-safety-and-effectiveness-data\" target=\"_blank\">regulated</a> as drugs, which means getting new ingredients approved is an expensive and time-consuming process. Because they’re treated as cosmetics, European-made sunscreens can draw on a wider variety of ingredients that protect better and are also less oily, less chalky and last longer. Does the FDA’s lengthier and more demanding approval process mean U.S. sunscreens are safer than their European counterparts? Not at all. In fact, American sunscreens may be <em>less</em> safe.</p>\r\n<p>Sunscreens protect by blocking ultraviolet rays from penetrating the skin. Ultraviolet B (UVB) rays, with their shorter wavelength, primarily affect the outer skin layer and are the main cause of sunburn. In contrast, ultraviolet A (UVA) rays have a longer wavelength, penetrate more deeply into the skin and contribute to wrinkling, aging and the development of melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer. In many ways, UVA rays are more dangerous than UVB rays because they are more insidious. UVB rays hit when the sun is bright, and because they burn they come with a natural warning. UVA rays, though, can pass through clouds and cause skin cancer without generating obvious skin damage.</p>\r\n<p>The problem is that American sunscreens work better against UVB rays than against the more dangerous UVA rays. That is, they’re better at preventing sunburn than skin cancer. In fact, many U.S. sunscreens <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.ewg.org/sunscreen/report/does-europe-have-better-sunscreens/\" target=\"_blank\">would fail European standards for UVA protection</a>. Precisely because European sunscreens can draw on more ingredients, they can protect better against UVA rays. Thus, instead of being safer, U.S. sunscreens may be riskier.</p></blockquote>\r\n<p>Most op-eds on the sunscreen issue stop there but I like to put sunscreen delay into a larger context:</p>\r\n<blockquote><p>Dangerous precaution should be a familiar story. During the Covid pandemic, Europe approved rapid-antigen tests much more quickly than the U.S. did. As a result, the U.S. floundered for months while infected people unknowingly spread disease. By one careful estimate, <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w28031/w28031.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">over 100,000 lives could have been saved</a> had rapid tests been available in the U.S. sooner.</p></blockquote>\r\n<p>I also discuss <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/05/the-left-on-fda-peer-approval.html\">cough medicine</a> in the op-ed and, of course, I propose a solution:</p>\r\n<blockquote><p>If a medical drug or device has been approved by another developed country, a country that the World Health Organization recognizes as a <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_stringent_regulatory_authorities#:~:text=A%20stringent%20regulatory%20authority%20(SRA,and%20vaccines%20for%20marketing%20authorization.\" target=\"_blank\">stringent regulatory authority</a>, then it ought to be fast-tracked for approval in the U.S…Americans traveling in Europe do not hesitate to use European sunscreens, rapid tests or cough medicine, because they know the European Medicines Agency is a careful regulator, at least on par with the FDA. But if Americans in Europe don’t hesitate to use European-approved pharmaceuticals, then why are these same pharmaceuticals banned for Americans in America?</p>\r\n<p>Peer approval is working in other regulatory fields. A <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.german-way.com/for-expats/living-in-germany/german-drivers-license-reciprocity/#:~:text=Germany%20%E2%80%93%20Only%20written%20test%20required%20%E2%80%93%20no%20road%20test&amp;text=The%20following%20states%20have%20no,%2C%20Rhode%20Island%2C%20and%20Vermont.\" target=\"_blank\">German driver’s license</a>, for example, is recognized as legitimate — i.e., there’s no need to take another driving test — in most U.S. states and vice versa. And the FDA does recognize some peers. When it comes to food regulation, for example, the FDA recognizes the Canadian Food Inspection Agency as a peer. Peer approval means that food imports from and exports to Canada can be sped through regulatory paperwork, bringing benefits to both Canadians and Americans.</p>\r\n<p>In short, the FDA’s overly cautious approach on sunscreens is a lesson in how precaution can be dangerous. By adopting a peer-approval system, we can prevent deadly delays and provide Americans with better sunscreens, effective rapid tests and superior cold medicines. This approach, supported by both sides of the political aisle, can modernize our regulations and ensure that Americans have timely access to the best health products. It’s time to move forward and turn caution into action for the sake of public health and for less risky time in the sun.</p></blockquote>\r\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/05/deadly-precaution.html\">Deadly Precaution</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com\">Marginal REVOLUTION</a>.</p>\r\n<img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/897844097/0/marginalrevolution\" />\r\n<div><a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/897844097/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/897844097/marginalrevolution,\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/897844097/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/x.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/897844097/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/897844097/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/05/deadly-precaution.html#comments\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/comments20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/05/deadly-precaution.html/feed\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/commentsrss20.png\" /></a> \r\n<div><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/05/deadly-precaution.html#comments\"><h3>Comments</h3></a><ul><li><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/05/deadly-precaution.html#comment-160762115\">I think it I’d important to distinguish between chemical ...</a> <i>by Bayesfactor</i></li><li><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/05/deadly-precaution.html#comment-160762113\">In reply to Phil S..
