I loved it. I could always get a car if I really needed one, and I could see how much extra I was paying and decide if I didn’t need it. I was grateful that Uber let me pay other people to postpone their trip for a while, and send a loud signal that more drivers are needed. But drivers reported that everyone else hated it and felt cheated.</p>\r\n<p>This cultural and moral disapproval came home to me strongly about 25 years ago. We were driving from Chicago to Boston in our minivan, with 4 young children, dog, and my mother. We got to upstate NY, and needed to stop for the night. This was before cell phones and the internet, so the common thing to do was just pull of at a big freeway intersection, marked food, phone, gas, lodging, and see what’s available. Nothing. We tried hotel after hotel. We asked them to call around. Nothing. It turns out this was the weekend of Woodstock II. As the evening wore on, the children were turning in to pumpkins. Finally we found a seedy Super-8 motel that had 2 rooms left, for $400. This was back when Super-8 motel rooms were about $50 at most. I said immediately “Thank you, we’ll take them!” My mom was furious. “How dare he charge so much!” I tried hard to explain. “If he charged $50, or $100, those rooms would have been gone long ago and we’d be sleeping in the car tonight. Thank him and be grateful! He’s a struggling immigrant, running a business. We don’t need presents from people who run Super-8s in upstate New York.” But, though an amazing, smart, wise, and well-traveled woman, she wasn’t having it. Nothing I could do would persuade her that the hotel owner wasn’t being terrible in “taking advantage of us.”</p>\r\n<p>It is surely morally worthy to give what you have to your neighbors in time of need, especially the less fortunate. But we should not demand gifts. And appropriation of property by threat of force, turning off the best mechanism we know for alleviating scarcity, does not follow. Moral feelings are a terrible guide for laws.</p></blockquote>\r\n<p>If we can’t get the moms on board we are going to have a tough time.
