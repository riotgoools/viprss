Just about the first trick in here is Fabio successfully jumping the Lyon 25 Stair <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/03/brutal-lyon-25-stair-destroyer-of-action-sport-dreams\">we learned about earlier this week</a>. And, uh, he does something we didnâ€™t see in that other video because if you make it to the end of the video, youâ€™ll see he starts from the set of stairs going down to the Lyon 25 instead of starting on the flat like everyone else. Sheesh.</p>\n\n<p>I also like how he takes the corner/curb at :50 and the stairs at 3:20 and the stairs at 5:15. Sheesh. </p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/bicycles\">bicycles</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/cycling\">cycling</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Fabio%20Wibmer\">Fabio Wibmer</a></p>\n\n <p>ðŸ’¬ <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/03/urban-freeride-fabio-wibmer\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> â†’</p>\n\n    ","author":"Aaron Cohen","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"8b75b42f8ab2143a804c84925d303f77662afd14cf3c87ccbe53862570e2d8c9","category":"default"}
