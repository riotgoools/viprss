Instagram meme pages and news accounts in particular have suffered as Meta cracked down on “disinformation,” often failing to distinguish obvious humor from legitimate false information. </p><p>As <em>The Verge</em> <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/3/24311513/meta-content-moderation-mistakes-nick-clegg\">reported</a>, “Meta’s automated systems have become too ham-fisted. Examples of ‘moderation failures’ were <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/9/24266096/instagram-threads-moderation-account-post-deleted-limited\">recently trending</a> on Threads, which has been plagued with takedown errors in recent months. The company publicly <a href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2024/07/review-of-fact-checking-label-and-meta-ai-responses/\">apologized</a> after its systems suppressed photos of President-elect Donald Trump surviving an attempted assassination. And its own Oversight Board <a href=\"https://www.oversightboard.com/news/summary-decision-on-satirical-harris-walz-image-highlights-risk-of-political-speech-being-suppressed-ahead-of-elections/\">recently warned</a> ahead of the US presidential election that its moderation errors risk the ‘excessive removal of political speech.’”</p><p>Of course, Meta only conveniently “realized” this problem following Zuckerbeg’s dinner with Trump about a week ago. And, while the company claims that the realization was related to a review of its moderation surrounding content about the COVID pandemic, it’s hard to believe that considering Meta is still down-ranking and shadow banning creators who mention Long COVID, masking, and public health. </p><p>Ultimately, I think this is Meta trying to appeal to a new Republican-led administration that has railed against content moderation for years. I think it’s going to be choppy waters for Meta however, because despite what Republicans claim, conservatives  actually tend to be just as pro-heavy handed moderation as liberals, they just want different content censored.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.usermag.co/subscribe?\"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p>I  would love to see Zuckerberg <em>actually</em> lean into free expression on his platform while providing users with more robust audience controls and mass blocking features to ensure users can remain safe. Instagram and Threads could be thriving places for journalism and free and open dialogue about important topics and events, but significant changes would have to be made. </p><p>Meanwhile, Joe Rogan attempted to give Elon Musk credit for the soon to come moderation rollbacks. “It was looking pretty bleak, I would say, in terms of the direction internet censorship was headed,” Rogan said on his podcast Tuesday. “It seemed like the censorship machine was winning until around the time Elon purchased X.”</p><div><figure><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffff176a6-480a-4b2a-997d-0605025fbfd4_740x228.png\"><div><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffff176a6-480a-4b2a-997d-0605025fbfd4_740x228.png\" width=\"474\" height=\"146.04324324324324\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffff176a6-480a-4b2a-997d-0605025fbfd4_740x228.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffff176a6-480a-4b2a-997d-0605025fbfd4_740x228.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffff176a6-480a-4b2a-997d-0605025fbfd4_740x228.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffff176a6-480a-4b2a-997d-0605025fbfd4_740x228.png 1456w\" loading=\"lazy\" /><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Rogan then claimed that he and people like right wing billionaire Marc Andreessen see Musk’s purchase of X was a “fork in the road”, where Musk set a new standard for “free speech” for tech companies, including Meta. </p><p>Never mind that nothing about Musk’s ownership of Twitter fosters “free speech” — the platform censors content aggressively and arbitrarily, Musk restricts and permanently bans users he doesn’t politically agree with, and abuse has skyrocketed under Musk, silencing many marginalized users speech— but Rogan, Andreessen, etc are also just completely wrong about this timeline.</p><p> In the summer of 2022, well before Musk took Twitter’s helm, Facebook had already begun dramatically scaling back its anti-misinformation efforts, and the tide has been turning against cracking down on “disinformation” for quite a while, especially since the start of the pandemic, when <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/09/11/threads-covid-coronavirus-searches-blocked/\">Meta and other platforms</a> began <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/08/25/twitter-factual-covid-info-labeled-misinformation/\">banning many users for posting accurate public health information</a> while allowing conspiracy theories to run rampant. </p><p>As Jeff Bercovici at the SF Standard posted, “[Rogan gives] a complete misread of what happened. The swing away from aggressive policing of speech and truth by the platforms began well before Musk bought Twitter, mostly in response to political pressure, but also because it was costly and hard and the culture had shifted.” </p><div><div><div><p>User Mag is a 100% reader-supported publication.
