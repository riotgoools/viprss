A creative agency working for Oreos <a href=\"https://www.theinspiration.com/2024/06/oreo-kintsugi-by-leo-burnett-tailor-made-sao-paulo/\">came up</a> with the clever idea of selling tubes of Oreo frosting so that people could repair their broken Oreos in the same way.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<blockquote><p>Oreo’s ‘Kintsugi’ marketing campaign addresses the common issue of broken cookies by drawing inspiration from the ancient Japanese art. Kintsugi, which means “golden joinery,” is the practice of repairing broken pottery by mending the areas of breakage with lacquer dusted or mixed with powdered gold, silver, or platinum. This technique not only restores the item but also adds beauty and value to the breakage.</p>\n\n<p>Consumers often find broken Oreo cookies to be a disappointment, viewing them as imperfect and less enjoyable. However, the philosophy of Kintsugi teaches that there is beauty in imperfections and that items can become more valuable when repaired thoughtfully.</p></blockquote>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/advertising\">advertising</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/food\">food</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Japan\">Japan</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/pottery\">pottery</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/video\">video</a></p>\n\n         <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/06/oreo-kintsugi\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"c6555ebf8c4b3e6a621d83c7a8a7836d840213d0e646a6216d8d57c703d81599","category":"default"}
