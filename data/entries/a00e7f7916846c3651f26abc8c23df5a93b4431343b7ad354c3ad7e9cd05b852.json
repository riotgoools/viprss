I see the opportunity regardless of what else is going on. </p>\n<p>I could be wrong, I have been before. I kept using Twitter for identity after Musk took over, even though as time went by it was increasingly obvious that developers weren't part of his plan. I've been there before, with Apple, after Jobs came back. We had a great developer community for the web on the Mac, better than anything on Windows or Unix, and the management before Jobs, Heidi Roizen advising Gil Amelio, seemed to value our contribution, even if we weren't prospering. But there was a moment when Jobs introduced the open source equivalent of some of our products -- but it basically spelled the end of our little adventure, since Apple was putting the spotlight on them and not us.</p>\n<p>But it doesn't always go that way. I kept investing in the Mac in 1985, a very bad year for Apple, and in 1986 we had a huge hit, because we were almost alone in sticking it out, and of course it mattered that MORE was a lovely product. But if no one looks, it doesn't matter how lovely it is! </p>\n<p>Anyway, the WordPress world is huge. Far bigger than the blogosphere in the 90s and 00s. Maybe somehow the trouble with WordPress will mean that people who see WordPress as a writing platform will all leave now, or stop considering new ways of writing. </p>\n<p>But on the other hand, there isn't anything else out there that's offering something new for them. I think I'm pretty much alone working in this area. And maybe people need some good news? </p>\n<p>It's a medium size product. Less than a full word processor and more than a tiny little text box. I think there are a lot of WordPress users who will like it. So I'm going all the way with this one. I may lose the bet, but wtf, let's give it a try.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"a00e7f7916846c3651f26abc8c23df5a93b4431343b7ad354c3ad7e9cd05b852","category":"Sites"}
