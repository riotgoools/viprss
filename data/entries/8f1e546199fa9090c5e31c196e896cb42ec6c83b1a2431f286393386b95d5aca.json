These extreme conditions triggered a new phenomenon in the cosmos — the first <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2016/10/27/lise-meitner/\">nuclear fusion</a> reactions: When two hydrogen atoms collide with immense force, neutrons are transferred from one nucleus to the other, making some atoms larger. After a series of such collisions, a nucleus with two protons forms and the second element — helium — is born. As the star ignites, illuminating the austere darkness of pure spacetime surrounding it, it keeps burning its hydrogen to make more helium. The fusion accelerates, forging carbon, then neon, then oxygen, and so forth across the periodic table, turning the star into a kind of onion with layers of fusion reactions. </p>\n<p>Most of the first twenty-six elements in the periodic table — the elements composing almost everything we can touch and see — were created by nuclear fusion in individual stars. If you could tag any individual atom in your body and follow it backward in time, across all the other matter it composed before it became yours — your mother’s body, the food your mother ate, the soil in which that food grew, the geologic strata ground down by the oceans to make that soil — you could trace it all the way back to the core of a particular star that lived and died billions of years ago: an actual atom that is now in you, having prevailed over the infinite probabilities by which it could have ended up in someone else. </p>\n<p>To this Rube Goldberg machine of chance you owe all of your particularity — alter any part of that cosmic genealogy, and you would have ended up as someone else. </p>\n<figure><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/pillars-of-creation-eagle-nebula-in-infrared-nasaesa-hubble-space-telescope_print?sku=s6-22845835p4a1v1?curator=brainpicker\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/PillarsOfCreation_infrared.jpg?resize=680%2C638&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"680\" height=\"638\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/PillarsOfCreation_infrared.jpg?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/PillarsOfCreation_infrared.jpg?resize=320%2C300&amp;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/PillarsOfCreation_infrared.jpg?resize=600%2C563&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/PillarsOfCreation_infrared.jpg?resize=240%2C225&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/PillarsOfCreation_infrared.jpg?resize=768%2C720&amp;ssl=1 768w\" /></a><figcaption>Pillars of Creation, Eagle Nebula, Messier 16.

She was eight-four and the grandmother of seven when she received major recognition as a poet. By the time she died, having lived nearly a century and survived her husband’s suicide, she had been nominated for the Pulitzer Prize and won the National Book Award with her singular poems bridging the domestic and the cosmic, lensing the world of love and loss, of rapture and regret, through the world of galaxies and particles — poems shimmering with the spirit of <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/the-universe-in-verse/\"><em>The Universe in Verse</em></a> (which is now <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2024/05/01/the-universe-in-verse-book/\">a book</a>).</p>\n<p>This poem, found in <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/What-Love-Comes-Selected-Poems/dp/1556593279/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>What Love Comes To</em></strong></a> (<a href=\"https://search.worldcat.org/title/847673058\" target=\"_blank\"><em>public library</em></a>) — Stone’s final poetry collection, published just before her death at age 96 — was read at the seventh annual <em>Universe in Verse</em> by David Byrne.</p>\n<p></p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>STRINGS</strong><br />\n<em>by Ruth Stone</em></p>\n<p>We pop into life the way<br />\nparticles pop in and out<br />\nof the continuum.<br />\nWe are a seething mass<br />\nof probability.<br />\nAnd probably I love you.<br />\nThe evil of larvae<br />\nand the evil of stars<br />\nare a formula for the future.<br />\nSome bodies can<br />\nthrust their arms into<br />\na flame and be instantly<br />\ncured of this world,<br />\nwhile others sicken.<br />\nWhy think, little brother<br />\nlike the moon, spit out like<br />\na broken tooth.<br />\n“Oh,” groans the world.<br />\nThe outer planets,<br />\nthe fizzing sun, here we come<br />\nwith our luggage.<br />\nLook at the clever things<br />\nwe have made out of<br />\na few building blocks —<br />\nO fabulous continuum.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Follow the continuum forward into the science of <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2022/01/10/alan-lightman-death/\">what happens when we die</a>, then revisit David Byrne’s animated reading of Pattiann Rogers’s magnificent poem <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2022/02/18/achieving-perspective/\">“Achieving Perspective,”</a> with art by Maira Kalman, and Nick Cave’s animated reading of <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2024/04/06/but-we-had-music/\">“But We Had Music.”</a> </p>\n<hr /><h3>donating = loving</h3><p>For seventeen years, I have been spending hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars each month composing <em>The Marginalian</em> (which <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2021/10/22/brain-pickings-becoming-the-marginalian/\">bore the outgrown name <em>Brain Pickings</em></a> for its first fifteen years). It has remained free and ad-free and alive thanks to patronage from readers. I have no staff, no interns, no assistant — a thoroughly one-woman labor of love that is also my life and my livelihood.
