Since <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/10/hyperlinks-the-open-web-and-a-membership-appeal\">the membership program here at kottke.org</a> is eight years old (tomorrow!) and the first anniversary of <a href=\"https://kottke.org/23/10/introducing-the-new-kottke-comments\">the new commenting system</a> happened a couple of weeks ago, I thought it might be a good time to do another introduction thread. Hereâ€™s the prompt <a href=\"https://kottke.org/23/10/who-are-the-people-in-the-neighborhood\">from the last time we did this</a> (350+ comments!):</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>So, in the meantime, if you feel comfortable sharing, you can use this thread to introduce yourself: maybe where you live, what youâ€™re into, your social accounts. I think many of us smartly err on the side of not sharing too many specific details about ourselves online (myself included, but itâ€™s obviously complicated ðŸ™ƒ) due to safety issues, but I think itâ€™s possible to get to know each other a little bit without spilling too many beans.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>If youâ€™re a new member/commenter, tell us a little bit about yourself. If youâ€™ve commented here before, give us an update on what youâ€™ve been up to, what youâ€™re reading or watching, etc. If youâ€™re not a member and would like to participate and support the site, <a href=\"https://kottke.org/members/\">you can sign up for a membership here</a>.</p>\n\n        \n\n        \n\n         <p>ðŸ’¬ <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/10/who-are-the-people-in-the-neighborhood-part-two\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> â†’</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"3cf8cd74e32e41c2ca88eed624563683141756a4347fb5a81f08d7f2493092ce","category":"Sites"}
