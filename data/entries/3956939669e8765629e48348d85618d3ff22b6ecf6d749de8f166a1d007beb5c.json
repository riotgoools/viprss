After asserting that he’d graduated (and not retired) from professional tennis, Federer shared what he learned from his years on the pro circuit. Some excerpts from <a href=\"https://home.dartmouth.edu/news/2024/06/2024-commencement-address-roger-federer\">the transcript</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p><strong>“Effortless”… is a myth.</strong></p>\n\n<p>I mean it.</p>\n\n<p>I say that as someone who has heard that word a lot. “Effortless.”</p>\n\n<p>People would say my play was effortless. Most of the time, they meant it as a compliment… But it used to frustrate me when they would say, “He barely broke a sweat!”</p>\n\n<p>Or “Is he even trying?”</p>\n\n<p>The truth is, I had to work very hard… to make it look easy.</p>\n\n<p>I spent years whining… swearing… throwing my racket… before I learned to keep my cool.</p>\n\n<p>The wakeup call came early in my career, when an opponent at the Italian Open publicly questioned my mental discipline. He said, “Roger will be the favorite for the first two hours, and then I’ll be the favorite after that.”</p>\n\n<p>I was puzzled at first. But eventually, I realized what he was trying to say. Everybody can play well the first two hours. You’re fit, you’re fast, you’re clear… and after two hours, your legs get wobbly, your mind starts wandering, and your discipline starts to fade.</p>\n\n<p>It made me understand… I have so much work ahead of me, and I’m ready to go on this journey now. I get it.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>On talent:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>Yes, talent matters. I’m not going to stand here and tell you it doesn’t.</p>\n\n<p>But talent has a broad definition.</p>\n\n<p>Most of the time, it’s not about having a gift. It’s about having grit.</p>\n\n<p>In tennis, a great forehand with sick racquet head speed can be called a talent.</p>\n\n<p>But in tennis… like in life… discipline is also a talent. And so is patience.</p>\n\n<p>Trusting yourself is a talent. Embracing the process, loving the process, is a talent.</p>\n\n<p>Managing your life, managing yourself… these can be talents, too.</p>\n\n<p>Some people are born with them. Everybody has to work at them.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>On “it’s only a point”:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>In tennis, perfection is impossible… In the 1,526 singles matches I played in my career, I won almost 80% of those matches… Now, I have a question for all of you… what percentage of the POINTS do you think I won in those matches?</p>\n\n<p>Only 54%.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, even top-ranked tennis players win barely more than half of the points they play.</p>\n\n<p>When you lose every second point, on average, you learn not to dwell on every shot.</p>\n\n<p>You teach yourself to think: OK, I double-faulted. It’s only a point.</p>\n\n<p>OK, I came to the net and I got passed again. It’s only a point.</p>\n\n<p>Even a great shot, an overhead backhand smash that ends up on ESPN’s Top Ten Plays: that, too, is just a point.</p>\n\n<p>Here’s why I am telling you this.</p>\n\n<p>When you’re playing a point, it is the most important thing in the world.</p>\n\n<p>But when it’s behind you, it’s behind you… This mindset is really crucial, because it frees you to fully commit to the next point… and the next one after that… with intensity, clarity and focus.</p>\n\n<p>The truth is, whatever game you play in life… sometimes you’re going to lose. A point, a match, a season, a job… it’s a roller coaster, with many ups and downs.</p>\n\n<p>And it’s natural, when you’re down, to doubt yourself. To feel sorry for yourself.</p>\n\n<p>And by the way, your opponents have self-doubt, too. Don’t ever forget that.</p>\n\n<p>But negative energy is wasted energy.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>And “life is bigger than the court”:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>I worked a lot, learned a lot, and ran a lot of miles in that small space… But the world is a whole lot bigger than that… Even when I was just starting out, I knew that tennis could show me the world… but tennis could never be the world.</p>\n\n<p>I knew that if I was lucky, maybe I could play competitively until my late 30s. Maybe even… 41!</p>\n\n<p>But even when I was in the top five… it was important to me to have a life… a rewarding life, full of travel, culture, friendships, and especially family… I never abandoned my roots, and I never forgot where I came from… but I also never lost my appetite to see this very big world.</p></blockquote>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/commencement%20speeches\">commencement speeches</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Roger%20Federer\">Roger Federer</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/sports\">sports</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/tennis\">tennis</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/video\">video</a></p>\n\n         <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/06/a-few-lessons-from-roger-federers-dartmouth-commencement-speech\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"3956939669e8765629e48348d85618d3ff22b6ecf6d749de8f166a1d007beb5c","category":"default"}
