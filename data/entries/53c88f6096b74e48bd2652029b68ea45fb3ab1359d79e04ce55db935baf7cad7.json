Adam is a Harvard linguistics graduate and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/etymologynerd/reels/?hl=en\">content creator</a> who has an amazing <a href=\"https://etymology.substack.com/\">Substack</a> about how the internet is reshaping language.

Modern social media doesn’t allow for a direct link between creators and followers. Instead, the apps use algorithms to recommend curated content, which means that I have to <a href=\"https://etymology.substack.com/p/the-perils-of-online-communication\">modify my communicative style</a> to fit their constraints. I talk faster, with less nuance. I hyperbolize and exaggerate my natural voice, because I know that’s what the algorithm wants.</p><p>This is a nuisance for creators but a far more serious problem for politicians, who also have to reshape their messages around social media algorithms.</p><p>The implications, needless to say, are concerning. Research is already indicating that politicians are <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/19485506221083811\">engaging in greater online incivility than before</a> because they know that civil content garners less engagement. Other analyses suggest that the deliberate exaggeration of online opinions <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-22856-z\">causes increased polarization</a>, normalizing extreme views while damping moderate views. Marjorie Taylor Greene is always going to get more clicks than my rank-and-file congressman, Paul Tonko.</p><p>It wasn’t always like this. Consider FDR’s “Fireside Chats” between 1933 and 1944. Across a series of radio broadcasts, the president was able to guide the American people through the Great Depression, explain his policies, and debunk misinformation.</p><p>By speaking directly over radio, FDR was able to instantly reach over 60 percent of U.S. households. This communicative style, called <em>broadcast communication</em>, can be represented like this:</p><div><figure><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0c937cf8-b08c-4d28-9d53-538cb70371a9_610x418.jpeg\"><div><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0c937cf8-b08c-4d28-9d53-538cb70371a9_610x418.jpeg\" width=\"336\" height=\"230.24262295081968\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0c937cf8-b08c-4d28-9d53-538cb70371a9_610x418.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0c937cf8-b08c-4d28-9d53-538cb70371a9_610x418.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0c937cf8-b08c-4d28-9d53-538cb70371a9_610x418.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0c937cf8-b08c-4d28-9d53-538cb70371a9_610x418.jpeg 1456w\" loading=\"lazy\" /><div></div></div></a><figcaption>Sharad Goel et al., The Structural Virality of Online Diffusion, 62 Mgmt.

A TikTok only gets views if it generates enough algorithmic engagement to be recommended to more user feeds, and a tweet only goes viral if it gets enough retweets. Each post reaches a different audience, so politicians can’t expect their messaging to be consistent, or heard at all, unless they can make it go viral.</p><p>As such, candidates are reshaping their communication to perform better on algorithmic platforms. This means getting more likes, more shares, and more retention—which in turn means exaggerating and hyperbolizing, since less exciting content simply doesn’t go far on those platforms.</p><div><p>Candidates are reshaping their communication to perform better on algorithmic platforms.</p></div><p>Our move away from broadcast communication may also be <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/full/10.1145/3616088\">behind America’s well-documented rise</a> in online misinformation. </p><p>Algorithms use engagement as a metric for virality, and misinformation tends to generate more engagement. Claims about, say, Haitians eating household pets are going to elicit the extreme responses needed for virality. Even attempts to correct those falsehoods can paradoxically register as additional engagement.</p><p>Gone are the times of detail, accuracy, and nuance.

At least our politics are getting funnier. People like zingers, gimmicks, and stunts, so those do better in the algorithm than boring speeches.

All political campaigning is going to be meme-based in the future, because algorithms are only going to tighten their grip over our society. </p><p>Everything you’ve seen in recent elections—the jokes, the extremism, the misinformation—is here to stay, all because we switched from one style of communication to another.</p><div><div><a href=\"https://etymology.substack.com?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_campaign=publication_embed&amp;utm_medium=web\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F269f3738-583d-47ef-ad92-5f0a30fdbb11_1028x1028.png\" width=\"56\" height=\"56\" /><span>The Etymology Nerd</span><div>linguistic ruminations and updates</div></a></div></div><h2>How governments use facial recognition technology to crack down on protesters</h2><p>From the Arab Spring to Black Lives Matter to the Umbrella Revolution, large scale protests have shaken governments around the world. But over the past decade, facial recognition technology has made speaking out significantly more risky. Demonstrators can be picked out of a crowd, arrested, and even preemptively detained. </p><p><a href=\"https://www.usermag.co/subscribe?\"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p>Rest of the World published <a href=\"https://restofworld.org/2024/facial-recognition-government-protest-surveillance/\">a fantastic deep dive</a> on how facial recognition technology is being used to suppress freedom of speech around the world. From <a href=\"https://restofworld.org/2024/facial-recognition-government-protest-surveillance/\">Rest of World</a>: </p><blockquote><p>Over the past decade, there has been a steep rise globally in law enforcement using facial recognition technology. Data gathered by Steven Feldstein, a researcher with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, found that government agencies in <strong>78 countries now use public facial recognition systems.</strong></p><p>The public is often supportive of the use of such tech: 59% of U.K. adults told a survey they “somewhat” or “strongly” support police use of facial recognition technology in public spaces, and a Pew Research study found 46% of U.S. adults said they thought it was a good idea for society. In China, one study found that 51% of respondents approved of facial recognition tech in the public sphere, while in India, 69% of people said in a 2023 report that they supported its use by the police.</p><p>But while authorities generally pitch facial recognition as a tool to capture terrorists or wanted murderers, the technology has also emerged as a critical instrument in a very particular context: punishing protesters. </p><p>… In countries where demonstrating can come with physical or political risk, large-scale protests have historically offered a degree of anonymity, and, with it, a level of protection. Mass protests are a way for citizens to express dissent as a collective — often under the assumption that “they can’t arrest us all.” </p><p>But in the last decade, the spread of facial recognition technology has changed that equation: <strong>A lone face in a crowd is no longer anonymous; facial recognition allows authorities to capture people’s identities en masse.</strong> </p><p><strong>It’s no coincidence that the widespread adoption of the technology has evolved in parallel with increasingly draconian laws against protest.</strong> As part of its “Protect the Protest” project, Amnesty International tracks repressive legislation that imposes illegitimate restrictions on protests, with examples across five regions. Facial recognition tech helps enable this repression by offering a way to enforce such regulation on a sweeping scale.</p></blockquote><div><div><div><p>User Mag is a reader-supported publication.
