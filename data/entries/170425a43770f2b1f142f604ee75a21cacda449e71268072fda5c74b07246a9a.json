It was on every Apple device I have, never showed up in the ‘Unread Messages’ filtered view and I had tried everything short of resetting my phone. Yes, I asked all the AI bots.</p>\n<p>I decided to ask Perplexity again today and one of the suggestions, which I had not seen previously, was to ask Siri if I had any unread messages.

Miraculously, Siri finally did something actually useful.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"micro.brad","siteHash":"27daae1c149c6ec5a964b1fe9266f5a58f96cfb4b36e39006f255c6b2b53a76d","entryHash":"170425a43770f2b1f142f604ee75a21cacda449e71268072fda5c74b07246a9a","category":"Sites"}
