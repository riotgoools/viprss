If we are calling for Biden to step aside because someone must stop Trump from bringing down the republic, then surely it would have made more sense to first call for Trump to step aside? (The <a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/opinion/editorials/first-presidential-debate-joe-biden-donald-trump-withdraw-20240629.html\">Philadelphia Inquirer</a> did). I know the counter-arguments: his people wouldn’t have cared, and he wouldn’t have listened. The first misses an important point. There are quite a few Americans who have not made up their minds. The second amounts to obeying in advance. If you accept that a fascist is beyond your reach, you have normalized your submission.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>“Do not obey in advance” is Snyder’s very first lesson from <a href=\"https://kottke.org/16/11/fighting-authoritarianism-20-lessons-from-the-20th-century\">his 20 Lessons from the 20th Century about fighting authoritarianism</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>1. Do not obey in advance. Much of the power of authoritarianism is freely given. In times like these, individuals think ahead about what a more repressive government will want, and then start to do it without being asked. You’ve already done this, haven’t you? Stop. Anticipatory obedience teaches authorities what is possible and accelerates unfreedom.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Illustration by the awesome <a href=\"http://chrispiascik.com/\">Chris Piascik</a>.</p>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Donald%20Trump\">Donald Trump</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Joe%20Biden\">Joe Biden</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/politics\">politics</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Timothy%20Snyder\">Timothy Snyder</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/USA\">USA</a></p>\n\n        \n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"bfebe5aff5431345e4fc1a3a6401c2c0f579b26b92c0f07d05c67b562794ff53","category":"default"}
