{"title":"[RIDGELINE] Drumming is a Kind of Walking","link":"https://craigmod.com/ridgeline/162/","date":1684281600000,"content":"Ridgeliners —\nAbout six months ago I began drumming again. I had taken a fourteen year hiatus. I wrote up my return in Roden, and posted the essay as a standalone thing here: ”Drumming”.\nSix months later, and I’ve sat behind the kit almost every single day I’ve been home. Usually multiple times a day. It has become my thinking seat. The kit is electronic. I live in Japan and don’t have a soundproofed room in my studio, so the thought of playing an acoustic set, and barraging my neighbors with that banging, is enough to make my head retract fully into my chest.","author":"","siteTitle":"Craig Mod","siteHash":"7358923c3192bccfb6b9f0032f475bef5140f12de0f235c80ca3d98e1a3d393b","entryHash":"1390c364995ebd8a09883343013b05bd26235d7ccc4fcd77336eeae2ed17e1bf","category":"default"}
