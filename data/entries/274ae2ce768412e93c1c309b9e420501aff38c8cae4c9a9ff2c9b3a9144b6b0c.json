{"title":"How&#8217;s It Going Today?","link":"https://kottke.org/24/02/hows-it-going-today","date":1708623845000,"content":"\n        <p>I’m feeling a little retrospective and nostalgic today, so if you’ll indulge me, I’m going to acknowledge a couple of personal milestones.</p>\n\n<p>1. Today marks <em>19 years</em> of me doing kottke.org as a full-time job. What. The. Actual. F? I kinda can’t believe it. Before this, the longest I’d ever stayed at a job was about two years…and the average was closer to 9-12 months. Aside from dropping out of grad school <a href=\"https://kottke.org/16/10/www-the-way-we-were\">to bet my life on the World Wide Web</a>, choosing to turn this website into my job is the best decision I’ve ever made.</p>\n\n<p>Some of you may not know this, but when I <a href=\"https://kottke.org/05/02/kottke-micropatron\">went full-time</a>, I ran a three-week “pledge drive” to fund my activities on the site. In 2005, this was an almost unheard-of thing to do — people did not send money to strangers over the internet for their personal websites. But it worked: that initial boost sustained me that first year and allowed me to build this career sharing the best of the internet with you. Those brave folks got a pretty good return on their risky investment, I’d say.</p>\n\n<p>Several years ago, I circled back to the idea of a reader-funded site and since then, <a href=\"https://kottke.org/members/\">the membership program</a> has completely transformed the site and my engagement with the work I do here. Incredibly, some of the folks who supported me back in 2005 are still supporting me today — a huge thank you to them and to everyone else who has supported the site along the way.</p>\n\n<p>2. This is a less-obvious milestone with diffuse edges but one that came to mind this morning as I looked back at some photos from a couple of years ago. <a href=\"https://kottke.org/22/05/announcement-im-going-to-miss-you-but-i-am-taking-a-sabbatical\">When I announced I was taking a sabbatical in May 2022</a>, I wrote about my fiddle leaf fig and the metaphorical connection I seem to have with it:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>I’d brought this glorious living thing into my house only to kill it! Not cool. With the stress of the separation, my new living situation, and not seeing my kids every day, I felt a little like I was dying too.</p>\n\n<p>One day, I decided I was not going to let my fiddle leaf fig tree die…and if I could do that, I wasn’t going to fall apart either. It’s a little corny, but my mantra became “if my tree is ok, I am ok”. I learned how to water &amp; feed it and figured out the best place to put it for the right amount of light. It stopped shedding leaves.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>I went on to explain that my tree was not doing that well…and its condition was telling me that I needed a break. Well, what a difference the last two years have made. On the left is a photo I took two years ago today of my fig and on the right is from this morning:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/plus/misc/images/fiddle-leaf-growth.jpg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"875\" alt=\"side-by-side comparison of a fiddle leaf fig tree, two years apart\" /></p>\n\n<p>Oh, there are a couple of janky leaves in today’s photo (the product of some inattentive watering earlier this winter as I failed to adjust to the winter dryness), but the plant is happy in a bigger pot and there are several new leaves just from the past two weeks (as the amount of daylight increases). There are also two other fiddles in the house that are descended from cuttings I took from this one — they’re also thriving and both have new leaves coming in right now.</p>\n\n<p>I still have not written a whole lot about what I did (or didn’t do) during the seven months I was off, but after more than a year back, it seems pretty clear that the sabbatical did what I wanted it to. I feel like I’m thriving as much as my tree is. In recent months, I’ve launched a couple of new features (including <a href=\"https://kottke.org/23/10/introducing-the-new-kottke-comments\">the comments</a>, which I’ve been really pleased with) and <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/02/welcome-back-to-the-site-edith\">added another voice</a> to the site. There’s a new thing launching soon (*fingers crossed*) and I have plans for more new features, including improvements to the comments.</p>\n\n<p>More importantly, the site feels vital and fun in a way that it hasn’t for quite awhile. It’s not all sunshine and lollipops (nothing is — I’m looking at you, tax season), but I’m having a blast, am engaged with the work, and am feeling pretty fulfilled lately. So another huge thanks to everyone for hanging in there while I sorted my shit out — I appreciate you.</p>\n\n <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Jason%20Kottke\">Jason Kottke</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/kottke.org\">kottke.org</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/working\">working</a></p>\n\n <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/02/hows-it-going-today\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"274ae2ce768412e93c1c309b9e420501aff38c8cae4c9a9ff2c9b3a9144b6b0c","category":"default"}
