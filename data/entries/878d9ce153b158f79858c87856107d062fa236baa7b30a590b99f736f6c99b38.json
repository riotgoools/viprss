It was both a feed reader and a writing tool. </p>\n<p>One would have thought, btw, that from that start that all subsequent blogging tools would have the same connections, even if the functionality was not all in the same product. But then came Twitter and Facebook, and they said they weren't blogs, and presumably would start a new tradition with new user expectations. And that worked. </p>\n<p>So the integration opportunities were limited, something that took me 11 years to fully appreciate, and to give up on. I was in a intellectual cloud, not thinking straight. </p>\n<p>Meantime, the tradition of blogging was preserved by WordPress. As a blogging tool, it supported the same connective features that Radio did. There were some it couldn't cover because Radio was a desktop app, not a web app (though it looked like a web app, you installed a piece of software on the desktop). </p>\n<p>This was the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/davenet/1997/09/14/FractionalHorsepowerHTTPSe.html\">Fractional Horsepower HTTP Server</a> idea realized. </p>\n<p>So for example, we had <a href=\"http://radio.userland.com/userGuide/reference/howUpstreamingWorks\">upstreaming</a>, which was a one-way Dropbox, a number of years before Dropbox existed. This meant that the link between the CMS and the server went through the file system. The product didn't live long enough to fulfill the potential of that feature, unfortunately. The idea was that you could use any editor you wanted to write something that was posted to the blog, you could choose to have it rendered through the site template, or uploaded as-is. </p>\n<p>Years later I tried to do it with Dropbox itself, with a product called <a href=\"http://fargo.io/docs/whatIsFargo.html\">Fargo</a>. Dropbox was so incredibly close to the ideal user-owned storage server system, but they wouldn't go the final step, in creating a class of content that could be shared with two or more apps but not all apps. So the user didn't have enough control for it to work. </p>\n<p>The idea of multiple apps working on the same data would be revolutionary. How do I know? Because that's how computers worked before the web. So to make the thing I want to do work, now, in 2024, I'm going to have to create my own storage system for the user, and I will pay for it, at least to start. </p>\n<p>Hopefully at some point I'll be able to turn that over to Automattic and have them run it, or if they don't want to, maybe someone else will. But it has to be there for the web as a runtime environment to support the same diversity of software that the PC and Mac did in the generation before the web. </p>\n<p>Technology does go backwards, a lot -- we lose valuable things without any thought, when we could keep them. Anyway, more on this later for sure. </p>\n<p>BTW, that's why it's good to keep some old people around, we remember the things that were lost. I'm trying to make sure the really good ideas, the keepers, get another chance. </p>","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"878d9ce153b158f79858c87856107d062fa236baa7b30a590b99f736f6c99b38","category":"default"}
