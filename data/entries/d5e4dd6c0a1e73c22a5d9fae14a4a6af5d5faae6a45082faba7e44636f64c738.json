{"title":"Now Serving: Drinkable Mayonnaise","link":"https://kottke.org/24/12/now-serving-drinkable-mayonnaise","date":1733958307000,"content":"\n        <p><a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/asia/japan/mayonnaise-drinkable-mayo-japan-nomu-lawson-b2655230.html\">Lawson’s, a convenience store in Japan, has begun selling Nomu, a drinkable mayonnaise</a> forgetting the important adage: <em>all mayo is drinkable if you believe in yourself</em>.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>The only catch for pedantic mayonnaise lovers is that the label clarifies that Nomu mayo is a “mayonnaise-style drink” and “not mayonnaise”. Currently in a “test sale period”, it still remains to be seen if Nomu mayo actually appeals to Japanese customers, who are used to the thicker and richer taste of Japanese mayo, as opposed to more Western varieties.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p><img src=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/mayo-drink-3.jpg\" srcset=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=500,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/mayo-drink-3.jpg 500w, /cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/mayo-drink-3.jpg 1200w\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1300\" height=\"967\" alt=\"two cans of Japanese drinkable mayo\" /></p>\n\n<p>Unrelated, the best idea I ever had for a reality television program was “Uh Oh, It’s Mayo!” The premise being kind of like Cake or Not Cake (though this idea is from 2008) where the host goes around offering people the opportunity to taste different food products with some of them being 100% mayonnaise. It even had a theme song, the tune of which you’ll have to imagine unless you want to text me so I can send you a voice memo of it, but the lyrics are, “What’s in the pie, I don’t know. Uh oh it’s mayo!” Call me, Bravo.</p>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/food\">food</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Japan\">Japan</a></p>\n\n         <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/12/now-serving-drinkable-mayonnaise\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Aaron Cohen","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"d5e4dd6c0a1e73c22a5d9fae14a4a6af5d5faae6a45082faba7e44636f64c738","category":"Sites"}
