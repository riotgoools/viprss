For the past five years, Edelman has been working on a documentary about Prince for Netflix that aimed to understand an artist who resisted being known for much of his life and career. Edelman got access to Prince’s archive and talked to many of the people closest to him.</p>\n\n<p>But now Prince’s estate is objecting to the portrait of Prince painted by the film: a man of “multiplying paradoxes” who was a “creature of pure sex and mischief and silky ambiguity [but] also dark, vindictive and sad”. Sasha Weiss wrote <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/08/magazine/prince-netflix-ezra-edelman-documentary.html?unlocked_article_code=1.JE4.VC_A.oj-rZ872vsPB\">a fantastic article about the documentary, Edelman, and Prince for the New York Times Magazine</a>.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>When the screening ended, after midnight, Questlove was shaken. Since he was 7 years old, he said, he had modeled himself on Prince — his fashion, his overflowing creativity, his musical rule-breaking. So “it was a heavy pill to swallow when someone that you put on a pedestal is normal.” That was the bottom line for him: that Prince was both extraordinary and a regular human being who struggled with self-destructiveness and rage. “Everything’s here: He’s a genius, he’s majestical, he’s sexual, he’s flawed, he’s trash, he’s divine, he’s all those things. And, man. Wow.”</p>\n\n<p>I called Questlove a few months later, to see how it had all settled in his mind. He said he went home that night and spoke to his therapist until 3 a.m. He cried so hard he couldn’t see. Watching the film forced him to confront the consequences of putting on a mask of invincibility — a burden that he feels has been imposed on Black people for generations. “A certain level of shield — we could call it masculinity, or coolness: the idea of cool, the mere ideal of cool was invented by Black people to protect themselves in this country,” he said. “But we made it sexy. … We can take dark emotion and make that cool, too.”</p>\n\n<p>The night of the screening, he said he told his therapist, was a wake-up call: “I don’t want my life to be what I just saw there.” It was painful, he said, to “take your hero and subject him to the one thing that he detests more than life, which is to show his heart, show his emotion.”</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Ever if you’re not a particular fan of Prince, it’s worth reading the whole thing.</p>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Ezra%20Edelman\">Ezra Edelman</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/movies\">movies</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/music\">music</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Prince\">Prince</a></p>\n\n         <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/09/the-prince-documentary-you-might-never-see\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"3d3a130e583fd342ed55e18b490c48c965f7ae5cee084b586812dc77ff5c68ea","category":"Sites"}
