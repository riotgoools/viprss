It also has a huge snail heart because “to accommodate the oxygen needs of symbiotic bacteria that live in their bodies and provide most of their nutrition.” </p>\n\n<p>Longtime Kottke readers will remember my friend Chris Piascik who drew this metal snail after I told him about the other metal snail. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@chris-piascik/featured\">Chris has an excellent YouTube channel</a> where he talks about stuff I can’t really understand in an engaging and delightful way. In 2018, Chris and I spent about 6 months working together and putting out a kids’ book and he was mad at me every single day.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/ironsnail.jpg\" srcset=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=500,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/ironsnail.jpg 500w, /cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/ironsnail.jpg 1200w\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"2000\" alt=\"ironsnail.jpg\" /></p>\n\n <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/animals\">animals</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Chris%20Piascik\">Chris Piascik</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/snails\">snails</a></p>\n\n <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/03/these-snails-are-metal-as-hell\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Aaron Cohen","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"1f0ba4e03a9b445e5659db08fd115e919fe3d38fade29760a9a720aa71a7ec75","category":"default"}
