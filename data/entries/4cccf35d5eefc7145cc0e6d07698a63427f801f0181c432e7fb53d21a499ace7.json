These are basically things that seem too big to fix.</p>\n\n<p>Itâ€™s also far more likely that the narrative explores inner conflicts â€” moral dilemmas, identity crises, and wrestling with our understanding of what it means to be human. We donâ€™t just face outside threats; we also face threats within ourselves.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, todayâ€™s sci-fi stories are far more likely to be a commentary on current social issues. These might be critiques of political ideologies, runaway capitalism, irresponsible innovation, human apathy, or eroding mental health.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>(via <a href=\"https://studiodradiodurans.com/\">studio d</a>)</p>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Alvin%20Chang\">Alvin Chang</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/infoviz\">infoviz</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/movies\">movies</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/video\">video</a></p>\n\n         <p>ðŸ’¬ <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/07/how-sci-fi-movies-have-changed-since-the-50s\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> â†’</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"4cccf35d5eefc7145cc0e6d07698a63427f801f0181c432e7fb53d21a499ace7","category":"default"}
