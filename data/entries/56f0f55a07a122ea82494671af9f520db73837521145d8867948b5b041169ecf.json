Over the last few years I have grown to absolutely loathe the app. I’ve been using Apple Music the vast majority of the time. It’s calmer, I can actually find the music I’m looking for and it sounds better. There are great people at Spotify and they have done and continue to do great things, but when the KPIs show through to the interface, you’ve lost the plot. At some point they will realize this, but only when it hurts them financially.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"micro.brad","siteHash":"27daae1c149c6ec5a964b1fe9266f5a58f96cfb4b36e39006f255c6b2b53a76d","entryHash":"56f0f55a07a122ea82494671af9f520db73837521145d8867948b5b041169ecf","category":"default"}
