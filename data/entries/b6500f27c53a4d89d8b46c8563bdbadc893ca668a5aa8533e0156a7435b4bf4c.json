If you want to read the month in outline form, <a href=\"https://drummer.land/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scripting/Scripting-News/master/blog/opml/2024/03.opml\">click this link</a> and it will open read-only in <a href=\"http://drummer.land/\">Drummer</a>. That's a pretty good approximation of how I edit it, except I use the desktop version of Drummer that writes files to the local Mac filesystem as well as to the cloud.","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"b6500f27c53a4d89d8b46c8563bdbadc893ca668a5aa8533e0156a7435b4bf4c","category":"default"}
