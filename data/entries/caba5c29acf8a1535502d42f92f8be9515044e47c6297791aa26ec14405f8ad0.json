I crashed my bike this weekend and as such I’m a little banged up (neck &amp; wrist injuries). I’m mostly fine but I don’t know how much desk/mouse/typing time I can manage today. I’m gonna give it a shot though because I need some distraction and something else to do besides watch TV, lay flat on my back, and listen to podcasts. If I tap out early today, now you know what’s up. ✌️</p>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/cycling\">cycling</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Jason%20Kottke\">Jason Kottke</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/kottke.org\">kottke.org</a></p>\n\n         <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/09/black-and-blue-and-read-all-over\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"caba5c29acf8a1535502d42f92f8be9515044e47c6297791aa26ec14405f8ad0","category":"Sites"}
