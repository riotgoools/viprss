It was also true of blogging and podcasting. I thought for sure as soon as the ideas were out they'd take off. But most people had no idea. Most big new ideas come out of developers realizing something new is possible, shipping it, refining it and getting lucky. AI is the next one, I'm absolutely sure of it. But most people, even most developers, don't see the need and don't see it as inevitable. To make a fine point, we don't need AI, we didn't need PCs or GUIs or the web. But once we saw the power, there was no turning back. The same imho is true of AI. I've been trying to puzzle this out. How can we develop the amazing power and depth of knowledge of the machine combined with the creativity and deep yearning of humans. One thing I've learned from this year that I've been doing this as a user, the machine doesn;'t want to do anything. Don't anthropomorphize it that way. Try having a conversation with it and ask what it wants. It doens't understand the concept. It's not surprising that we think the machine will be like us, we always want something, we're so selfish species there is. But we'll learn to work with the machine, I already have, and we'll <i>evolve</i> through this. That's maybe the biggest skill our species has, the rate at which we can change.","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"540effa430379c9055ddd5b87dfd449546dee7dc685c70234c637ba9f244fe6d","category":"default"}
