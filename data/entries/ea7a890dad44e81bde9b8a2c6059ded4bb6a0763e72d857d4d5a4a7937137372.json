She didn't start broadcasting until three months before the election. That's not even one season of Abbott Elementary or Wheel of Fortune. Of course they didn't know her. We should be marketing the hell out of this shit all the time so when we choose a candidate the people will already know and like them.  </p>\n<p>I listened to a pathetic Daily Blast podcast <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/big-setback-for-trump-as-gopers-privately-tell-him/id1728152109?i=1000677605316\">yesterday</a> where Greg Sargent and his <a href=\"https://www.thebulwark.com/p/trump-cabinet-team-of-outlaws-gaetz-hegseth-gabbard-rfk\">guest</a> kept saying \"we gotta figure this out.\" </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/03/27/successionPoster.png\" />The answer is staring you in the face. Dems are only on the air for a few months every four years. Of course the other side spins you like crazy. </p>\n<p>You all are clinging to the \"gotcha\" model of journalism. There are no more gotchas. We've known that since <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_Access_Hollywood_tape\">Access Hollywood</a>. Fetterman is the only Dem I know of who practices this now.  (There are others, AOC and <a href=\"https://www.tammybaldwin.com/about/\">Tammy Baldwin</a> in Wisconsin have come to mind since I wrote that. There will be others.)</p>\n<p>Get on the air and relax and say what you really think. And when the Repubs lie, say it like that -- they're lying. When you say nothing people think you agree with them. Big point. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://imgs.scripting.com/2022/02/09/jobsWoz.png\" />The Gotcha Era is finally over. Thank god. Send a link to this piece to every Democratic Party influencer. Let's get going. I'll kick in $100 as soon as they reboot <a href=\"https://x.com/KamalaHQ\">KamalaHQ</a>. </p>\n<p>BTW, there should never again be a Democratic nominee who doesn't host their own podcast. Let's start there. </p>\n<p>Trump made a real impression when he <a href=\"https://www.rcfp.org/trump-covid-checks-abc-news/\">signed</a> the stimulus checks. I bet that got him a few votes.  </p>","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"ea7a890dad44e81bde9b8a2c6059ded4bb6a0763e72d857d4d5a4a7937137372","category":"Sites"}
