The Timothée Chalamet lookalike contest was held there on October 27th, and attracted a crowd of hundreds, including <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJNmee-qhCQ&amp;utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=finding-a-chalamesque-boyfriend\" target=\"_blank\">the man himself</a>. It was organized by YouTuber Anthony Po, who admitted to <span><i>The Hollywood Reporter</i></span> he <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/local-news/timothee-chalamet-lookalike-contest-organizer-interview-1236047019/?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=finding-a-chalamesque-boyfriend\" target=\"_blank\">initially planned to rig it</a> so he would win, but had to step back when the crowd got so rowdy that <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaB_IXoUYdA&amp;utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=finding-a-chalamesque-boyfriend\" target=\"_blank\">several Timothées were arrested</a>.</p><p>Po is your bog standard viral stunt influencer, so when something he does gets big, it’s worth investigating why.

Fair play on the second, but it’s the first that’s worth focusing on here.</p><div><img src=\"https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/a96efac5-7bce-4105-a6e6-b955189da28a/Screenshot_2024-12-02_at_2.12.04_PM.png?t=1733166739\" /><div><span><p>(<a href=\"https://x.com/jeremyoharris/status/1858404086779093335?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=finding-a-chalamesque-boyfriend\" target=\"_blank\">x.com/jeremyoharris</a>)</p></span></div></div><p>Viewed in a vacuum, the lookalike contests are definitely a little strange. But they’re actually totally in line with a bunch of other offbeat cultural moments lately. Barbenheimer, brat summer, Kendrick vs. Drake, they all bubbled up out of niche corners of fandom first, propelled by young people making content as a form of entertainment themselves. Which is fairly a novel idea. These trends may have eventually ended up looking like any other meme — with brands and politicians jumping in at the end — but they each started as something that felt decidedly too strange to co-opt.</p><p>And, yes, The Brands are beginning to try and find an angle on the lookalike contests — the various frantic Slack rooms that uphold America’s marketing industry, thankfully, move quite slow. Actor and humanoid capybara Glen Powell took charge of his own lookalike contest last week, <a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/article/what-happened-glen-powell-lookalike-contest.html?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=finding-a-chalamesque-boyfriend\" target=\"_blank\">appointing his mom</a> as a judge and awarding <a href=\"https://variety.com/2024/film/news/glen-powell-lookalike-contest-winner-parents-cameo-next-film-1236222542/?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=finding-a-chalamesque-boyfriend\" target=\"_blank\">a cameo in his next movie</a> as the grand prize. </p><p>Which brings us to the central tension here. It’s one that continues to pop up every time Gen Z launches a new meme. Much has been written about <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/millennials-struggling-absurdist-gen-z-humor-memes-2023-8?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=finding-a-chalamesque-boyfriend\" target=\"_blank\">how weird</a> their humor is, sure, but their tastes, at least as a group, are unabashedly mainstream and almost always collectivist. Compare the lookalike contests to one of the first big Gen Z memes, the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/08/style/minions-gentleminions-tik-tok-trend.html?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=finding-a-chalamesque-boyfriend\" target=\"_blank\">Gentleminions</a>. Dressing up with your boys to watch a Minions movie is surreal, but it also requires you going to the premiere of a billion-dollar children’s movie franchise. Barbenheimer, same deal. Gen Z were quick to grumble that brands were going to force a Barbenheimer down our throats every six months going forward, but it’s hard to complain about brands cashing in on a trend if that trend is you dressing up to watch the two highest grossing movies of the year.</p><p>This mix of normie and hyper-specific culture is even more pronounced on TikTok, where the barrier between an inside joke and a common reference, between liking something and participating in it, is nonexistent. That’s how you get lookalike contests for these less famous figures (who are still undeniably in the mainstream). </p><p>Which is the underlying appeal of these contests. Over the past 20 years, so much of what fandom means has been corporatized and financialized as the internet has made it easier to track. PopCrave has turned fan accounts into press teams, Funko Pops are a billion-dollar business, Comic-Con has become a shareholder meeting (and <a href=\"https://d23.com/every-disney-announcement-and-more-from-the-disney-investor-day-2020/?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=finding-a-chalamesque-boyfriend\" target=\"_blank\">vice versa</a>). But it’s a lot harder to co-opt a semi-spontaneous irl party, whether the theming is <a href=\"https://www.garbageday.email/p/x-matter?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=finding-a-chalamesque-boyfriend\" target=\"_blank\">Hegelian e-girl</a> or <a href=\"https://www.dailydot.com/memes/blue-tie-kid-tiktok/?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=finding-a-chalamesque-boyfriend\" target=\"_blank\">TikTok Rizz</a>. It’s not impossible, but you can tell tastes are shifting. </p><p>And this is what makes the lookalike contests different from the flashmobs that were embarrassingly popular a generation earlier. Flashmobs usually had some kind of meaning to them, an activist pretext or vague notion of social awareness. But these contests don’t really have any other meaning to them besides getting together, having fun, and, of course, making content.</p><hr /><p><i>The following is a paid ad.

Schlossberg also seems to be going through a breakup right now, as evidenced by his recent <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@jack.schlossberg/video/7442297695907155243?_r=1&amp;_t=8rr317c8Tug&amp;utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=finding-a-chalamesque-boyfriend\" target=\"_blank\">TikTok output</a>.</p><p>Amid all of the posting mania, Schlossberg also seems to be using Trump’s big win to stretch his brand a bit and actually try his hand at being a semi-serious political pundit. He was <a href=\"https://x.com/JBKSchlossberg/status/1862254144196608174?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=finding-a-chalamesque-boyfriend\" target=\"_blank\">posting</a> over the weekend about Musk undermining US military interests.</p><p>But the problem with taking Schlossberg seriously is he has a very specific kind of rich Massachusetts guy vibe, where everything he says sounds like he’s being sarcastic, but also appears to be totally genuine. It’s likely this is part of the reason he initially went viral, but is definitely making his, once again, seemingly earnest, pivot to leader of the new #Resistance, a bit confusing. </p><p>All that said, he cooked with this one:</p><div><img src=\"https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/bfbda88f-0065-4deb-ae51-e1e918b5ca68/Screenshot_2024-12-02_at_12.30.00_PM.png?t=1733160636\" /><div><span><p>(<a href=\"https://x.com/JBKSchlossberg/status/1863625255148810356?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=finding-a-chalamesque-boyfriend\" target=\"_blank\">x.com/JBKSchlossberg</a>)</p></span></div></div><hr /><h2>ChatGPT Can’t Talk About A Certain Guy</h2><div><img src=\"https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/192a32b6-21dc-470a-810f-8270e9fae1c8/Screenshot_2024-12-02_at_12.38.48_PM.png?t=1733161140\" /><div><span><p>(ChatGPT)</p></span></div></div><p>Here’s a weird thing.

Interestingly enough, it seems like ChatGPT could accept “David Mayer de Rothschild” before all of this blew up, but, as of this morning, when I checked it, “David Mayer de Rothschild” now also breaks ChatGPT, as well. “David Rothschild” and “David de Rothschild” both still work. Also, the block does n’t <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/andy.baio.net/post/3lcdq72wepc22?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=finding-a-chalamesque-boyfriend\" target=\"_blank\">seem to be happening</a> on the API level.</p><p>The leading theory here is that it’s related to the European Union’s <a href=\"https://www.dataprotection.ie/en/individuals/know-your-rights/right-erasure-articles-17-19-gdpr?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=finding-a-chalamesque-boyfriend\" target=\"_blank\">right to be forgotten</a> GDPR provision, but it’s curious that it’s only being applied to ChatGPT. I put both “David Mayer” and “David Mayer de Rothschild” into Midjourney and not only did it accept both prompts, it actually generated images of Mayer. But it’s also possible it’s related to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/16/akhmed-one-armed-isis-terrorist-alias-david-mayer-historian-secret-watch-list?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=finding-a-chalamesque-boyfriend\" target=\"_blank\">completely different David Mayer</a>.</p><hr /><h2>The Slop Aesthetic Of The 2020s</h2><blockquote><p></p><p>BOMB ft.

It’s, of course, horrible, which should be expected at this point. But the video also features AI-generated footage. I think it may feature some real shots of West’s children, North and Chicago, who are also sampled on the track, but it could possibly all be AI-generated.</p><p>“I’ve been warning people to prepare themselves for the worst aesthetic era of our lifetimes,” <i>The Information</i> reporter Julia Black <a href=\"https://x.com/mjnblack/status/1862589588771947003?s=12&amp;t=GArJOEJ41SKT7sLfzFsugQ&amp;utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=finding-a-chalamesque-boyfriend\" target=\"_blank\">wrote on X</a>. “But I fear nothing can prepare us for what’s to come…,” comparing the 2020s slop aesthetic to previous garbage style eras like the 2000s.</p><p>With Trump entering the White House again next month, and folks like Elon Musk scurrying in along with him, it seems likely that, yes, this is just how this decade is going to look.
