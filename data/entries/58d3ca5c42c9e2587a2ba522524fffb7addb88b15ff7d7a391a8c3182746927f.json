I’m merely a high school graduate. I studied art in a correspondence course because I was afraid to go to art school. I couldn’t see myself sitting in a room where everyone else in the room could draw much better than I and this way I was protected by drawing at home and simply mailing my drawings in and having them criticized.</p>\n\n<p>I wish I had a better education but I think that my entire background made me well-suited for what I do. If I could write better than I can, perhaps I would have tried to become a novelist and I might have become a failure. If I could draw better than I can, I might have tried to become an illustrator or an artist and would have failed there. But my entire being seems to be just right for being a cartoonist.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Charles Schulz: Unbothered. Moisturized. Happy. In his lane. Focused. Flourishing.</p>\n\n<p>See also <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOK_EcFYLlQ\">a 90-minute compilation of cartoonists working</a> (from the same YT channel) and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBSfOZWJYQ\">Chuck Jones demonstrating how to draw Bugs Bunny and other characters</a>.
