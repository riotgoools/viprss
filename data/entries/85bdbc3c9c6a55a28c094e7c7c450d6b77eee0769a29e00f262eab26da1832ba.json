They celebrate their being silenced at conferences. They celebrate their being silenced on podcasts and streaming outlets. They celebrate their being silenced with over 700 book titles about being canceled. Why are there so many of these fucking books?</p>\n\n<p>Conservatives have an entire industry devoted to complaining about not being allowed to say the things they say all the time. Their victimhood is the entire brand.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>And:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>We are not censored or silenced. We are surrounded by and inundated with more speech than has ever existed in the history of communication.</p></blockquote>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Jon%20Stewart\">Jon Stewart</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/politics\">politics</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/video\">video</a></p>\n\n        \n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"85bdbc3c9c6a55a28c094e7c7c450d6b77eee0769a29e00f262eab26da1832ba","category":"default"}
