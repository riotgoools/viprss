I deleted all of my posts along with my avatar some time ago, but still have an account and enjoy scrolling through things once a week or so. Questlove consistently posts great things and last week <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/C7Imjo-oH0t/\">he posted</a> what is, I think, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/C6MaKffNW-V/\">one of the best Instagram posts ever</a> from some dude who calls himself <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/show_bits\">show_bits</a>. He has some other posts as well.
