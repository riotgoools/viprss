I had some follow-up questions, so I requested access to the underlying data from the folks at TRG.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also wanted to see how California stacked up as a state. Based on the index created by TRG, San Jose ranks as the top city in California for digital connectivity, followed by Sacramento and San Francisco.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"440\" src=\"https://149366103.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-02-at-8.34.20 AM-1024x440.png\" srcset=\"https://149366103.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-02-at-8.34.20 AM-1024x440.png 1024w, https://149366103.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-02-at-8.34.20 AM-300x129.png 300w, https://149366103.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-02-at-8.34.20 AM-768x330.png 768w, https://149366103.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-02-at-8.34.20 AM-192x83.png 192w, https://149366103.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-02-at-8.34.20 AM-560x241.png 560w, https://149366103.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-02-at-8.34.20 AM.png 1056w\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I also wanted to find out the top cities by price per megabit per second. Based on the TRG data, here is the ranking of the top 10 cities based on the lowest <strong>price per Mbps (from</strong> the most cost-effective to least cost-effective):</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"567\" src=\"https://149366103.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Top-Cities-by-Price-1024x567.png\" srcset=\"https://149366103.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Top-Cities-by-Price-1024x567.png 1024w, https://149366103.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Top-Cities-by-Price-300x166.png 300w, https://149366103.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Top-Cities-by-Price-768x425.png 768w, https://149366103.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Top-Cities-by-Price-192x106.png 192w, https://149366103.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Top-Cities-by-Price-1100x609.png 1100w, https://149366103.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Top-Cities-by-Price-560x310.png 560w, https://149366103.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Top-Cities-by-Price.png 1242w\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Louisville seems to be a pretty amazing place to live the broadband dream on a budget, but San Jose isn’t bad either.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>December 2, 2024.
