Since 2017, theyâ€™ve been helping organizations document environments over time by compiling photos taken by visitors, who then get sent information about the area theyâ€™ve visited. Hereâ€™s how it works:</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<blockquote><p>Changes in our environment are difficult to see and understand because they happen gradually, but long term monitoring projects are expensive and complex. Chronolog solves this problem by connecting communities with land stewards to create crowd-sourced time lapses of important natural areas.</p>\n\n<p>Chronologâ€™s mission is twofold: First, to engage people with nature in an interactive new way. Second, to keep a record of phenological change for scientific use. By making environmental conservation a collaborative activity, people become interested in participating and compelled by the findings.</p></blockquote>\n\n        \n\n <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/environment\">environment</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/time%20lapse\">time lapse</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/video\">video</a></p>\n\n <p>ðŸ’¬ <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/02/crowdsourced-time-lapses-that-help-monitor-the-environment\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> â†’</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"e92355bfd3384ca28b03b84e42f7b4b89cc3fa73244e21639e8a86fa52093563","category":"default"}
