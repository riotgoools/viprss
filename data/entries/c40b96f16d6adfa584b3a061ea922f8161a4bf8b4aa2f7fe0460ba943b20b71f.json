And wouldn't that be nice. <span>❤️</span> </p>\n<p>But do you remember part of the 2016 postmortem was that yeah it was a problem for the racists among us that we elected a black president, and now they want a woman president. Many of us thought this is the price we're paying for the euphoria we felt in 2008.</p>\n<p>All he says about Harris is true. She's a dream candidate, she had my vote at \"Hello.\" How could anyone <i>not</i> see what's so obvious, here's someone who organized her party's support in the blink of an eye, and she was ready to run, all the pieces were in place in record time. Such competence, drive, humor, did I say drive? :-)</p>\n<p>I worry that maybe all that was enough to get her even with Trump because now we're pressing the race and gender button again, and they still don't buy the idea of a non-white-male, Christian president.</p>\n<p>Oh and btw her husband is Jewish, and... all the childless bullshit. </p>\n<p>So I worry that we may be borderline fucked again. Pray. Pray, even if you don't believe.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"c40b96f16d6adfa584b3a061ea922f8161a4bf8b4aa2f7fe0460ba943b20b71f","category":"Sites"}
