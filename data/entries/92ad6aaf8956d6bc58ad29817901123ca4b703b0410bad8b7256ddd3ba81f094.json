The party attracted popular Tumblr creators, early YouTubers, bloggers, and internet enthusiasts. It was such a hit that the organizers decided to join up again that fall to host the first ever official <a href=\"https://andrearosen.biz/hallowmeme\">“HallowMeme”</a>. </p><p>HallowMeme was <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2012/10/best-costumes-from-the-2012-hallowmeme-party.html\">an annual party</a> in New York where hundreds of young millennials and Gen Xers <a href=\"https://ny.racked.com/2014/10/31/7570677/hallowmeme\">dressed up as their favorite chronically online references</a>. The event <a href=\"https://gothamist.com/arts-entertainment/photos/know-your-hallowmeme-51-photos-from-last-nights-meme-costume-party\">was a wild success and got so big</a> that it eventually expanded to Los Angeles. HallowMeme marked a time when memes, and the online videos they were often borne from, were just becoming mainstream. </p><p>Now, 15 years later, the online world is our default reality and Halloween costumes <a href=\"https://x.com/Yoshirox10/status/1847504053619630169\">have gone full brain rot</a>. One of the most popular Halloween costumes for children this year is Skibidi Toilet (<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/07/24/skibidi-toilet-movie-tv-franchise-youtube-michael-bay/\">as in the YouTube series</a>). The internet is <a href=\"https://www.dailydot.com/pop-culture/best-halloween-meme-costumes-2024/\">overrun with guides</a> explaining how to dress up as the Hawk Tuah girl or whatever viral ephemera is currently trending on Google.

In 2012, just three years after the first HallowMeme, CNN <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2012/10/30/world/halloween-memes-irpt/index.html\">ran a special report</a> on memes inspiring Halloween costumes. A 2013 piece for <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2013/10/halloween-meme-costumes/\">WIRED</a> documented how “dressing up as an internet meme” was becoming more popular. Vice <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/what-kind-of-shitty-halloween-party-will-you-end-up-at/\">lamented</a> the rise of meme costumes, claiming that those who indulge in them have “Buzzfeed as their homepage and they’re all too socially awkward to look up from their phones long enough to actually talk to one another.”</p><p>During this time the “social butterfly” costume took off, largely thanks to tumblr, where groups of hyper online young women dressed up as the different social networks. Costumes referencing the online world continued to grow in popularity throughout the 2010s as the internet and social platforms played a bigger role in all of our lives. </p><div><figure><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff56eb186-9352-4633-bcc9-8eab73dc4c80_612x612.jpeg\"><div><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff56eb186-9352-4633-bcc9-8eab73dc4c80_612x612.jpeg\" width=\"612\" height=\"612\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff56eb186-9352-4633-bcc9-8eab73dc4c80_612x612.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff56eb186-9352-4633-bcc9-8eab73dc4c80_612x612.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff56eb186-9352-4633-bcc9-8eab73dc4c80_612x612.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff56eb186-9352-4633-bcc9-8eab73dc4c80_612x612.jpeg 1456w\" /><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>While the meme <a href=\"https://gothamist.com/arts-entertainment/photos/know-your-hallowmeme-51-photos-from-last-nights-meme-costume-party\">costumes on display at HallowMeme</a> were hand made, as internet culture seeped deeper into public consciousness, ecommerce outlets sought to commodify the online world for profit. Spirit Halloween sped up their production to issue more timely Halloween costumes related to events and online characters. Yandy, a lingerie company, began creating “sexy” costumes of online references that repeatedly went viral. They produced a <a href=\"https://www.irishmirror.ie/news/weird-news/pizza-rat-inspires-sexy-halloween-6582715\">sexy “pizza rat” costume</a> in 2015 and a <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2016/10/yandy-sexy-ken-bone-costume/\">sexy undecided voter costume</a> based on Ken Bone the next year. </p><p>But this rise in meme costumes also created a culture clash.

Instead of connecting, I feel alienated, and not just because I don’t understand. Within seconds of embarking on these conversations, it becomes clear the costumes aren’t intended for my—or any other partygoer’s—consumption. They’re for our phones.</p><p>That’s where the costume will be appreciated, and where people can reenact the video required for it to make sense.

Half the fun of Halloween is being creative, and the internet is a wellspring of costume-worthy material. </p><p>While people argue for a return to witches, ghosts, and goblins, meme costumes allow for a level of self-expression beyond what’s offered by the traditional wardrobe. Donning a meme costume acknowledges that reality today is primarily mediated by the internet, and Halloween allows us to memorialize those meaningful online moments that are increasingly ephemeral. A good meme costume captures the zeitgeist while allowing the wearer to process and express their own relationship to the online world.</p><p>So, if you want to dress up as an Instagram post Rebecca Black liked one time, or JD Vance’s sexy couch having a demure Brat summer, go for it.
