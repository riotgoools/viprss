Last week featured <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/09/26/upshot/ten-minute-challenge-bridge.html?unlocked_article_code=1.OE4.LEvh.vnA4zILCeFKR\">a woodblock print by Utagawa Hiroshige called Great Bridge: Sudden Rain at Atake</a>, a piece that Vincent van Gogh had in his personal collection and <a href=\"https://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/en/collection/s0114V1962\">painted a version of himself</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I didnâ€™t expect to last the entire 10 minutes â€” a slow start to the day (dentist, errands) had me feeling rushed and a computer with an infinite number of apps &amp; websites just a tab or click away is not the ideal medium for this exercise â€” but once I got going (or, rather, once I slowed down), it was pretty easy.
