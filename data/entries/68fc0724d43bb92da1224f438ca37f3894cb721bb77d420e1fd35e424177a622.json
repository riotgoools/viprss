I wanted to be a writer like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Baker\">Russell Baker</a>. I was quoted by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Safire\">William Safire</a> in an op-ed. I have done some of the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/davenet/2002/04/10/newYorkTimesAndUserland.html\">most successful work</a> of my career with the NYT. I love journalism <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2018/06/24/181734.html\">like I love the Mets</a>. I don't expect them to do great things every season, but I do hope for a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1969_New_York_Mets_season\">1969</a> or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1986_New_York_Mets_season\">1986</a> every once in a while. These days I don't have much hope for the NYT returning to its former glory. I also wonder if they ever really were that great, that maybe I was just a naive young hero-seeker, growing up in Queens in the 1960s. We <i>all</i> have to work together to dig out of the hole we're in. And that means reporters have to start looking at themselves, and they have to listen to us, the people who care about the job that we need journalism to do, that it isn't doing.","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"68fc0724d43bb92da1224f438ca37f3894cb721bb77d420e1fd35e424177a622","category":"default"}
