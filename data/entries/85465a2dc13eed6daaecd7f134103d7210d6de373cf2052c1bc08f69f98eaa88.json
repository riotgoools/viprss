Her work, spanning over a hundred countries, includes spending a decade as a conflict photographer in places like Kosovo, Gaza, and Kashmir.</p>\r\n<p>She joined Tyler to discuss why we should stay scary to pandas, whether we should bring back extinct species, the success of Kenyan wildlife management, the mental cost of a decade photographing war, what she thinks of the transition from film to digital, the ethical issues raised by <em>Afghan Girl</em>, the future of National Geographic, the heuristic guiding of where she’ll travel next, what she looks for in a young photographer,  her next project, and more.</p></blockquote>\r\n<p>Here is one excerpt:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>As you probably know, there’s a long-standing and recurring set of <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.newstatesman.com/ideas/2020/11/moral-conflict-between-environmentalism-and-animal-welfare\" target=\"_blank\">debates between animal welfare advocates and environmentalists</a>. The animal welfare advocates typically have less sympathy for the predators because they, in turn, kill other animals. The environmentalists are more likely to think we should, in some way, leave nature alone as much as possible. Where do you stand on that debate?</p>\r\n<p><strong>VITALE: </strong>It depends. It’s hard to make a general sweeping statement on this because in some cases, I think that we <em>do</em> have to get involved. Also, the fact is, it’s humans in most cases who have really impacted the environment, and we do need to get engaged and work to restore that balance. I really fall on both sides of this. I will say, I do think that is, in some cases, what differentiates us because, as human beings, we have to kill to survive. Maybe that is where this — I feel like every story I work on has a different answer. Really, I don’t know. It depends what the situation is. Should we bring animals back to landscapes where they have not existed for millions of years? I fall in the line of no. Maybe I’m taking this in a totally different direction, but it’s really complicated, and there’s not one easy answer.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>And:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>As you know, there are now social networks everywhere, for quite a while. Images everywhere, even before <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.midjourney.com/home?callbackUrl=%2Fexplore\" target=\"_blank\">Midjourney</a>. There are so many images that people are looking at. How does that change how you compose or think about photos?</p>\r\n<p><strong>VITALE: </strong>Well, it doesn’t at all. My job is to tell stories with images, and not just with images. My job as a storyteller — that has not changed. Nothing has changed in the sense of, we need more great storytellers, visual storytellers. With all of those social media, I think people are bored with just beautiful images. Or sometimes it feels like advertising, and it doesn’t captivate me.</p>\r\n<p>I look for a story and image, and I am just going to continue doing what I do because I think people are hungry for it. They want to know who is really going deep on stories and who they can trust. I think that that has never gone away, and it will never go away.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>I am very happy to have guests who do things that not everyone else’s guests do.</p>\r\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/02/my-conversation-with-the-excellent-ami-vitale.html\">My Conversation with the excellent Ami Vitale</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com\">Marginal REVOLUTION</a>.</p>\r\n<img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/869231549/0/marginalrevolution\" />\r\n<div><a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/869231549/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/869231549/marginalrevolution,\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/869231549/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/869231549/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/869231549/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/02/my-conversation-with-the-excellent-ami-vitale.html#comments\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/comments20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/02/my-conversation-with-the-excellent-ami-vitale.html/feed\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/commentsrss20.png\" /></a> \r\n<div><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/02/my-conversation-with-the-excellent-ami-vitale.html#comments\"><h3>Comments</h3></a><ul><li><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/02/my-conversation-with-the-excellent-ami-vitale.html#comment-160715533\">In reply to HB.
