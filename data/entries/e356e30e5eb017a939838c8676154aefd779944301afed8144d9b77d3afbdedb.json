She has a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/s?k=kara+swisher+burn+book&amp;hvadid=673834124081&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvlocphy=1023511&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvqmt=b&amp;hvrand=4553868743109009067&amp;hvtargid=kwd-2231804831244&amp;hydadcr=22122_13323353&amp;tag=googhydr-20&amp;ref=pd_sl_1th6nk73pi_b\">book</a> coming out. This made me stop and try to think of a single instance where I learned something from her reporting. But she really is popular these days. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kara_Swisher\">She</a> did the <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/hbos-succession-podcast/id1522790936\">Succession podcast</a> for HBO, and being a huge fan of the show, I listened to it, and felt she did a good job, but honestly I didn't care whether she liked something or not. She is popular with other journalists. Her theme appears to be that it's the personalities that matter, not what the companies do. I don't think she has a whole lot of insight into the products and technology. For some reason, the technology itself, which mystifies a lot of history and english majors, is considered irrelevant or optional, or maybe kind of cute, by the typical reporter. So she expresses tech in terms the journalists understand, you know -- boys and girls, but mostly boys, and therefore they like her. And like the other reporters who thought Facebook's API was wonderful and kind of a miracle, did she realize that it was the API that was the core reason the network was used so effectively by marketers and Russian agents. Knowing a little bit about the technology, or knowing people who know about it who you trust who can advise you, is pretty important. Honestly, I don't think Swisher is one of those people. I could be wrong, btw. Anyway, I did plug her book here, and as <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=all+publicity+is+good+publicity\">they say</a> as long as they spell your name correctly all publicity is good publicity. And if you read the book, like it or think I should read it, please drop me a line. <span>ðŸ˜„</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"e356e30e5eb017a939838c8676154aefd779944301afed8144d9b77d3afbdedb","category":"default"}
