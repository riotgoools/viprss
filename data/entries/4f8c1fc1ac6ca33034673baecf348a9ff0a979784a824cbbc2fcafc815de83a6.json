Experts believed it could help jumpers go further by using the bodyâ€™s natural rotation to boost momentum. The flip would turn the jumperâ€™s upward motion into forward motion, potentially adding crucial inches to the jump.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/physics-of-the-banned-front-flip-long-jump/\">This Wired article</a> delves deeper into the physics of the somersault jump:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>Delamereâ€™s technique might have added significant distance to long jumps. Many experts think it could have broken the 30-foot mark. (The world record is 29 feet, 4 inches.) But he was never given the chance, because the sporting authorities said it was too dangerous. Evidently theyâ€™d never seen gymnastics or ski jumping.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Thatâ€™s right, the flip technique was quickly banned and never used in competition again.
