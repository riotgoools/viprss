It would enable people to send messages across these boundaries, but wouldn't handle the engagement features, likes, replies, forwarding. It's what many people are starting to do now, by hand. There's no way to put it off, imho -- the Bluesky limit is already hard to deal with. </p>","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"2c30509d321ce4c6883f258bce61978a3409b66a08e7e132238045de40a6aac0","category":"Sites"}
