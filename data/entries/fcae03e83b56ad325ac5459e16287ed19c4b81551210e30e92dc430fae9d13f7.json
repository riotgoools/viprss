{"title":"Time Travel Movies, Ranked","link":"https://kottke.org/24/03/time-travel-movies-ranked","date":1710273656000,"content":"\n        <p></p>\n\n<p>For Ars Technica, science writer Jennifer Ouellette and theoretical physicist Sean Carroll <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/features/2023/11/the-ars-guide-to-time-travel-in-the-movies/\">review time travel used in 20 popular movies</a>, ranging from The Terminator to Bill and Ted’s Excellent Adventure to Interstellar. Each movie is rated on scientific accuracy and how entertaining the use of time travel is. Here’s part of their review of Superman (1978).</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>Our standards are admittedly lax when it comes to the physical mechanism by which cinematic heroes journey through time, but “flying really fast around the Earth so that it reverses the direction of its rotation and sends it back to a previous moment” is such thoroughgoing lunacy that one must almost pause in admiration. Then we return to our senses and ask, “Why does Superman’s flight have any effect on the rotation of the Earth? And what does that rotation have to do with the direction of time? Do I get younger if I start twirling counterclockwise?” No, dear reader, you do not. Indeed, by the rules handed down by Einstein, Superman’s near-speed-of-light journey would actually send him into the future, not into the past.</p>\n\n<p>To its dubious credit, Superman pioneers two different flaws that will frequently recur in movies to come. First, time travel is portrayed as a miraculous cure-all, which is then never used again. Superman essentially goes back in time to save his girlfriend. This is admirable, but aren’t there other, more historically significant global disasters that could be averted by the same strategy? This is a narrative problem, not a scientific or logical one, but it rankles.</p>\n\n<p>Then, of course, there is the flaw that almost always accompanies stories in which the past gets changed by time-travelers: Where did those time-travelers come from? We, the viewers, see a sequence of events that seems to make sense if we don’t think too hard. Lois Lane dies, Superman gets upset, he travels back in time, stops the events that led to Lois dying, and we live happily ever after. But at the end of this sequence, Superman still has the memory of Lois dying the first time around. Yet because he changed history, that event he remembers never happened. Lois certainly doesn’t remember it. How does he?</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>See also <a href=\"https://kottke.org/17/11/the-various-approaches-to-time-travel-in-movies-books\">The Various Approaches to Time Travel in Movies &amp; Books</a>.</p>\n\n <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/best%20of\">best of</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Jennifer%20Ouellette\">Jennifer Ouellette</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/lists\">lists</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/movies\">movies</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Sean%20Carroll\">Sean Carroll</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/time%20travel\">time travel</a></p>\n\n <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/03/time-travel-movies-ranked\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"fcae03e83b56ad325ac5459e16287ed19c4b81551210e30e92dc430fae9d13f7","category":"default"}
