{"title":"Reading About Listening to J.S.

Bach. Called <a href=\"https://yearofbach.substack.com/\">Year of Bach</a>, it often includes more Bach than I can handle, but in a good way, and I like letting it wash over me. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://yearofbach.substack.com/p/an-interlude-where-to-start-with\">Yesterday’s installment</a> was more of a primer — I mean it was literally labeled “Where to start with Bach” and “a primer for new listeners” — which was especially up my alley.  </p>\n\n<blockquote>Through this project, I’m attempting to write for the masses about a niche topic, which embeds the danger of writing for no one. So today I want to recognize my readers who are in earlier stages of their Bach journeys, and in this post I’ll be recommending some of the grassier pathways into this music.</blockquote>\n\n<p>Of the tracks and musicians he linked to, my favorite is the Yo-Yo Ma, Chris Thile, and Edgar Meyer rendition of Bach’s Trio Sonata No. 6 in G Major (above), from their Bach Trios album of 2017. I also loved Brad Mehldau’s <a href=\"https://youtu.be/_txeK7lR-KE?si=_YwM_fhaBAablzdQ\">Prelude No. 3 in C Major from The Well-Tempered Clavier Book I</a>, which Goldfine describes as “damned perfect, a one track playlist on repeat forever.” </p>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Brad%20Mehldau\">Brad Mehldau</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Chris%20Thile\">Chris Thile</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/classical%20music\">classical music</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Edgar%20Meyer\">Edgar Meyer</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Evan%20Goldfine\">Evan Goldfine</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Johann%20Sebastian%20Bach\">Johann Sebastian Bach</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/music\">music</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Yo-Yo%20Ma\">Yo-Yo Ma</a></p>\n\n         <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/05/reading-about-listening-to-js-bach\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Edith Zimmerman","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"85dfbe9ff48b0076c66e350f854181632a81be3a1f0c2f8d138a9895ecbc79c8","category":"default"}
