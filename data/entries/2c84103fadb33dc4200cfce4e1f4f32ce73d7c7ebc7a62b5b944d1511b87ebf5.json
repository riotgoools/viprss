{"title":"Teens are making thousands debating Trump vs. Harris on TikTok","link":"https://www.usermag.co/p/teens-are-making-thousands-debating","date":1725966153000,"content":"<div></div><h2>The real political debate is on TikTok Live</h2><p>TikTok Live is a strange and dystopian place, but as the U.S. election heats up, I noticed not long ago that my entire feed has become political livestream battles. Young people, some not even old enough to vote, are raking in thousands of dollars a month through these streams. They debate who people should vote for and fight about the candidates’ policies and views on social issues. </p><p>Many of these debates take place on TikTok Live Match, a feature that originated in China but has skyrocketed in popularity in the U.S. On  live match, two creators go up against each other in round that last five minutes. As they fight with each other viewers attempt to boost their favored creator by showering them with virtual gifts (little digital animations that come on screen in the form of an ice cream cone or things like animals) that correlate to real cash value. </p><p>Sometimes the loser will endure a joke punishment like shaving their moustache, pouring a drink on their head, or doing something embarrassing. The live matches initially took off among mainstream influencers as <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@screenshothq/video/7309537143465053472\">a quick and easy way to make a large amount of money</a>. YouTube star and former Vlog Squad member Jason Nash <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hT_jnqO8qbI\">was doing them for hours daily at one point</a>. </p><p>But as the 2024 presidential election approaches, a group of creators, known as “political battlers,” have adopted the format to stage political debates and are finding massive success. Viola Zhou at <em>Rest of World</em> wrote <a href=\"https://restofworld.org/2024/tiktok-live-battle-how-to-us-election/\">an excellent piece on the phenomenon</a>:</p><blockquote><p>On TikTok Live, creators have made money in the past from debates pitting personalities like <a href=\"https://x.com/abbieasr/status/1507415018647998464\">Vladimir Putin against Volodymyr Zelenskyy</a>, and Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva against his predecessor and opponent Jair Bolsonaro. Globally, TikTok is playing an increasing role in hosting political discussions. Ahead of 2024 elections in countries including <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/dance-moves-deepfakes-indonesia-presidential-candidates-duke-it-out-tiktok-2024-02-12/\">Indonesia</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjerdlw4jeqo\">the U.K.</a>, <a href=\"https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20240621-how-france-s-far-right-is-winning-the-tiktok-battle\">France</a>, <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/tiktok-curtail-germany-far-right-mep-eu-election-candidate-maximilian-krah-conspiracy-theory/\">Germany</a>, and <a href=\"https://restofworld.org/2024/mexico-presidential-election-tiktok-dance/\">Mexico</a>, politicians have sought to reach out to young voters by not only promoting policies but also dancing, singing, and mocking their opponents with silly memes.</p></blockquote><p>The live battles are netting students up to $7,000 a month, and some are using it to pay college tuition: “Easiest money we will probably ever make.”</p><blockquote><p>On the afternoon of August 19, Democrat Liam Keyes entered a TikTok battle. Against a blue background, the 19-year-old lashed out at his Republican opponent, fellow TikToker “Jackson,” who donned a “Trump 2024” cap and spoke in front of a Donald Trump portrait. More than 150 viewers joined the room. </p><p>“She listens to us, bro. She is not self-centered!” Keyes, in a black hoodie, hollored from one side of the split screen. “She puts the people before herself.” </p><p>“Just wait until she gets into an actual debate,” Jackson, livestreaming from the other side, fought back. “You’re gonna see how much of an idiot Kamala Harris really is!” </p><p>The showdown took place through a niche TikTok feature called “live match.” As the 2024 presidential election approaches, a group of creators, known as “political battlers,” have adopted the format to stage political debates. </p><p>Keyes started doing live matches in the spring, after noticing how many gifts streamers received for debating politics. As a liberal, he reached out to conservative creators on TikTok, inviting them to live matches. The hustle paid off quickly. Keyes makes $100 to $1,000 from one night’s battling. </p></blockquote><p>You can watch my full discussion with Viola about TikTok political battles above 👆, or listen to the latest episode of <em>Power User</em> wherever you get your podcasts. </p><p><a href=\"https://www.usermag.co/subscribe?\"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><h2>The Webby <strong>Awards goes all in on creators</strong></h2><p>For those of us who make things for the internet, winning a Webby Award is an accomplishment.
