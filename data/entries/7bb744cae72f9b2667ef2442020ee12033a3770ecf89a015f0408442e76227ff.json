The UK economy not specializing in making things that either foreigners or its own citizens want to buy.  In other words, trends turned against the country.  Its brand of European/global finance and business services just didn’t do that well.  Where were the major tech companies?  Was it in the right segments of manufacturing at the right time?  (For <em>part</em> of that period, Germany was. The Netherlands still is.)  Did it ride any boom in resource prices, as Australia and Canada did?  No.</p>\r\n<p><strong>50 percent</strong>.  Over the decades, I see growth rates move around so much, even when policies don’t change much, that this is usually my #1 culprit.</p>\r\n<p>2. Brexit: <strong>20 percent</strong>.</p>\r\n<p>3. NIMBY: <strong>15 percent</strong>.</p>\r\n<p>4. Lack of cheap energy, energy building restrictions: <strong>10 percent</strong>.</p>\r\n<p>5. General decrepitude of some of the population somehow mattering more than before: <strong>5 percent</strong>.  Keep in mind we are trying to explain the recent growth gap here, not theorizing about levels.  Otherwise it would be more.</p>\r\n<p>Those are just guesstimates folx, what do you all think?</p>\r\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/04/apportioning-the-causes-of-the-uk-growth-shortfall.html\">Apportioning the causes of the UK growth shortfall</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com\">Marginal REVOLUTION</a>.</p>\r\n<img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/883612550/0/marginalrevolution\" />\r\n<div><a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/883612550/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/883612550/marginalrevolution,\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/883612550/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/x.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/883612550/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/883612550/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/04/apportioning-the-causes-of-the-uk-growth-shortfall.html#comments\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/comments20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/04/apportioning-the-causes-of-the-uk-growth-shortfall.html/feed\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/commentsrss20.png\" /></a> \r\n<div><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/04/apportioning-the-causes-of-the-uk-growth-shortfall.html#comments\"><h3>Comments</h3></a><ul><li><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/04/apportioning-the-causes-of-the-uk-growth-shortfall.html#comment-160751338\">In reply to PK.
