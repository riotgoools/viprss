The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1683969278/ref=nosim/0sil8\">book</a> is due out May 28, but there’s a (wonderful!) <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/diary-of-an-abomination\">excerpt in the New Yorker</a>, where the whole thing is called “well worth the wait.”</p>\n\n<p>I’ll probably reread Book One to prepare, in case anyone wants to join me. I <em>loved</em> this book. (I also <a href=\"https://drawinglinks.substack.com/p/monsters\">drew about it</a> in my newsletter once!)</p>\n\n <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/books\">books</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Emil%20Ferris\">Emil Ferris</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/graphic%20novels\">graphic novels</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/my%20favorite%20thing%20is%20monsters\">my favorite thing is monsters</a></p>\n\n <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/03/my-favorite-thing-is-monsters-the-sequel\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Edith Zimmerman","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"484ae237ca55cd5914786f37b1906c501c352b1d8d5bdd7be044c4f7c2593bf4","category":"default"}
