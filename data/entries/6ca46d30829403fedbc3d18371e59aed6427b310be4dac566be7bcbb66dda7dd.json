He asked a whole bunch of things but stopped short of asking the question that would have nailed him.</p>\n<p>Mr Durst, would you kill someone to avoid being convicted of killing your wife?</p>\n<p>From what we know of Durst he would have had a hard time saying no. When he's caught he generally admits he's caught. </p>\n<p>They got the conviction anyway. </p>\n<p>PS: I don't recommend either season but having watched the first, I was kind of committed to watching the second. He's a truly despicable character. </p>","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"6ca46d30829403fedbc3d18371e59aed6427b310be4dac566be7bcbb66dda7dd","category":"default"}
