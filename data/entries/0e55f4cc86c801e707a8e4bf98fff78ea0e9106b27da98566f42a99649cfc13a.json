So I fired up ChatGPT and asked if Asimov went to Science, and <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com/share/81199c5a-ca0a-4a2c-b610-e0799722a03f\">it said yes</a>. Then I asked where he went to high school and it said Bronx Science. But by then I was pretty sure he didn't, so I went to Google and meta.ai, and neither knew where he went to high school. So I asked on Twitter, Mastodon, <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@davew/112321321415008740\">Blue Sky</a> and Threads. Not sure why I even care! Oh well. <span>ðŸ˜„</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"0e55f4cc86c801e707a8e4bf98fff78ea0e9106b27da98566f42a99649cfc13a","category":"default"}
