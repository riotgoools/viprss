It reminds you that even the sturdiest-seeming features of our world are ephemeral, that in 1,100 years, Earthâ€™s axis will point to a new North Star. In 250,000 years, an undersea volcano will pop up in the Pacific, adding an extra island to Hawaii. In the 1 million years that the Great Pyramid will take to erode, the sun will travel only about 1/200th of its orbit around the Milky Way, but in doing so, it will move into a new field of stars. Our current constellations will go all wobbly in the sky and then vanish.</p>\n\n<p>Some aspects of the timeline are more certain than others. We know that most animals will look different 10 million years from now. We know that the continents will slowly drift together to form a new Pangaea. Africa will slam into Eurasia, sealing off the Mediterranean basin and raising a new Himalaya-like range across France, Italy, and Spain. In 400 million years, Saturn will have lost its rings. Earth will have replenished its fossil fuels. Our planet will also likely have sustained at least one mass-extinction-triggering impact, unless its inhabitants have learned to divert asteroids.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>I wrote about the timeline <a href=\"https://kottke.org/12/12/timeline-of-the-far-future\">back in 2012</a> (and again in <a href=\"https://kottke.org/17/08/infographic-of-the-fascinating-timeline-of-the-far-future\">2017</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://kottke.org/19/03/timelapse-of-the-future\">2019</a>).</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>The timeline of the far future article is far from the longest page on Wikipedia, but it might take you several hours to get through because it contains so many enticing detours. Whatâ€™s Pangaea Ultima? Oooh, Roche limit! The Degenerate Era, Poincarâ€™e recurrence time, the Big Rip scenario, the cosmic light horizon, the list goes on and on.</p></blockquote>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Ross%20Anderson\">Ross Anderson</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/science\">science</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/space\">space</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/timelines\">timelines</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Wikipedia\">Wikipedia</a></p>\n\n         <p>ðŸ’¬ <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/10/what-does-our-far-future-look-like\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> â†’</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"2d8ab82fb303cc71dcc09b0df192264905e6eb5ddea568c211195c6f9e5d37eb","category":"Sites"}
