It's often found in the sidebar of a blog. The purpose of a blogroll is to share recommendations with readers and to connect with the broader blogging community. By including a blogroll, a blogger can provide their audience with access to additional resources, opinions, or communities that share similar interests. It can also serve as a tool for networking and building relationships with other bloggers, through mutual linking or acknowledgment. Blogrolls were more prominent in the early days of blogging but can still be found on many sites today.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I couldn't improve on that, so I published it as-is.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"aebc5d4892541a671c39b8e65ba879503e977dda4c3fa67f791a0ea5a41275e8","category":"default"}
