{"title":"[RIDGELINE] The People of Morioka","link":"https://craigmod.com/ridgeline/156/","date":1676764800000,"content":"Ridgeliners â€”\nI have a new New York Times piece out. I also just published a big behind the scenes writeup over in Roden. Head over there for the breakdown on the events of the last month.\nHere, on Ridgeline, I want to feature some of the wonderful people I met walking around Morioka two weeks ago. I recommend clicking through and reading this on the web, since the photos will look much better there.","author":"","siteTitle":"Craig Mod","siteHash":"7358923c3192bccfb6b9f0032f475bef5140f12de0f235c80ca3d98e1a3d393b","entryHash":"e29a68ad08bc193eeb6f71f37ea3c1964716ec0abddd90b238e30450b1fb5580","category":"default"}
