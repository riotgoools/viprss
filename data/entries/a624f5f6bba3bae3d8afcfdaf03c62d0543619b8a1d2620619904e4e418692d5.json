Now, some people are working towards building an artificial general intelligence. So what happens when humans are matched or even far outclassed by this new general intelligence?</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>Such an intelligence explosion might lead to a true superintelligent entity. We donâ€™t know what such a being would look like, what its motives or goals would be, what would go on in its inner world. We could be as laughably stupid to a superintelligence as squirrels are to us. Unable to even comprehend its way of thinking.</p>\n\n<p>This hypothetical scenario keeps many people up at night. Humanity is the only example we have of an animal becoming smarter than all others â€” and we have not been kind to what we perceive as less intelligent beings. AGI might be the last invention of humanity.</p></blockquote>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/artificial%20intelligence\">artificial intelligence</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Kurzgesagt\">Kurzgesagt</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/video\">video</a></p>\n\n         <p>ðŸ’¬ <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/08/artificial-general-intelligence-might-be-humanitys-last-invention\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> â†’</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"a624f5f6bba3bae3d8afcfdaf03c62d0543619b8a1d2620619904e4e418692d5","category":"default"}
