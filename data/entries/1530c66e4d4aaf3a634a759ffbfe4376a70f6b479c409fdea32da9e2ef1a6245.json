My iPhone 13 Pro also had 256 GB and I had nearly 100 GB left, so I didn’t see a reason to get more storage. I ordered it last night and it was delivered via courier for $9 this morning, which felt like magic. The time it would have taken me to pick it up at the nearest store was worth way more than $9.</p>\n<p>The screen is noticeably nicer and it has only the slightest bezel. It really does feel like a leap forward coming from the 13 Pro. And I haven’t even messed around with the camera yet. My car unfortunately does not have wireless CarPlay and now I have to get an adapter or new cable to connect the USB-C to a USB-A port in my car, which is annoying.</p>\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/4832/2024/a57301f451.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" />","author":"","siteTitle":"micro.brad","siteHash":"27daae1c149c6ec5a964b1fe9266f5a58f96cfb4b36e39006f255c6b2b53a76d","entryHash":"1530c66e4d4aaf3a634a759ffbfe4376a70f6b479c409fdea32da9e2ef1a6245","category":"Sites"}
