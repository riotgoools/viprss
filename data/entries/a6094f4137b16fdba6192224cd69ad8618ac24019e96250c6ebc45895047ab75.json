The Democratic Party process would not produce an electable candidate against a Republican with dozens of criminal charges against him.  Not even in an election that is supposed to have such enormous stakes.</p>\r\n<p>2. The Democratic Party process would not produce a better candidate than a guy who, whatever the reality may be, is regarded by most of the American public as too old.  Not even in an election that is supposed to have such enormous stakes.</p>\r\n<p>3. An open Democratic Party convention would badly embarrass itself, if it were on the television (and internet) every evening.  Remember Chicago 1968?</p>\r\n<p>4. An open Democratic Party convention would be chaos, and perhaps commandeered by party extremists.</p>\r\n<p>5. “Dealing” with Kamala Harris, whether that means accepting her as the nominee, or easing her out, somehow involves unacceptable consequences.</p>\r\n<p>6. There are other arguments floating around too.</p>\r\n<p>I am not saying these arguments are <em>true</em> (mostly I don’t know), I am merely reporting that I am reading and hearing them, and yes I mean from Democrats.</p>\r\n<p>Most of all, I am struck by how skeptical and cynical these arguments are about democracy.  It’s not even democracy in the “can we beat the Trumpers?” sense, but democratic processes <em>internal to the Democratic Party</em>.</p>\r\n<p>Skepticism about democracy — yet never ever explicitly voiced — is a growing problem among Democratic Party thinkers (though not Ezra).  On one hand, they wish to turn around and call people on the Right, or libertarians, “undemocratic,” or “anti-democratic,” or whatever.  On the other hand, when it comes to actual decisions of great consequence, they are the ones terrified of the democratic processes they themselves have created.  They know that, but can’t quite bring themselves to voice their doubts in those terms.</p>\r\n<p>I am pleased to see that I am more positive on democracy than so many of the Democratic Party thinkers.  I don’t have any particular predictions about the 2024 cycle, but I can report that I am not short the market.  What I observe, however, is just how many people are shorting democratic processes and ideals.  Must, sooner or later, a greater consistency between theory and practice reign?  Or are professed views simply the handmaiden of political convenience, and they will, one way or another, disperse and end up blowing in the wind?</p>\r\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/02/well-functioning-democracy-for-neither-me-nor-for-thee.html\">Well-functioning democracy for neither me nor for thee?</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com\">Marginal REVOLUTION</a>.</p>\r\n<img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/871834637/0/marginalrevolution\" />\r\n<div><a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/871834637/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/871834637/marginalrevolution,\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/871834637/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/x.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/871834637/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/871834637/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/02/well-functioning-democracy-for-neither-me-nor-for-thee.html#comments\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/comments20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/02/well-functioning-democracy-for-neither-me-nor-for-thee.html/feed\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/commentsrss20.png\" /></a> \r\n<div><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/02/well-functioning-democracy-for-neither-me-nor-for-thee.html#comments\"><h3>Comments</h3></a><ul><li><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/02/well-functioning-democracy-for-neither-me-nor-for-thee.html#comment-160720657\">In reply to Anti-Gnostic.
