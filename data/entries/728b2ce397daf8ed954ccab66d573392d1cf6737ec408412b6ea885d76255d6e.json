{"title":"A Weekend of Letting Go","link":"https://ghuneim.com/2024/07/22/a-weekend-of-letting-go/","date":1721648343000,"content":"<p>This weekend marked two significant firsts in my life, both involving parting with cherished possessions.</p>\n<p>Photograph Sale</p>\n<p>I sold a photograph that had adorned my walls for years, bringing joy every time I looked at it. This was my first time ever selling anything. Christie’s handled the sale, and I hope the piece will find a new home with someone who will appreciate it as much as I did.</p>\n<p>CD Collection Farewell</p>\n<p>I also sold off my collection of 5,000 CDs, which I hadn’t touched in some time. Initially, this seemed like an obvious decision – a no-brainer when I first considered it. However, as I went through the collection, I found myself awash in memories and rediscovering music that’s no longer available online. At the last minute, I almost changed my mind.</p>\n<p><em>(The decision feels even more perplexing when I remember that I still have most of the important music on vinyl.)</em></p>\n<p>A New Perspective</p>\n<p>My new theory is that this is just another step in the journey of artworks and books finding their place in the world. These possessions are moving on, continuing their own stories beyond my walls and making me lighter and more focused in the process.</p>","author":"MDG","siteTitle":"Mark Ghuneim","siteHash":"fbdbfb355dab5247b3a3d9c04401313e99252873a1ae0fb1ea729c2e5736c6f3","entryHash":"728b2ce397daf8ed954ccab66d573392d1cf6737ec408412b6ea885d76255d6e","category":"default"}
