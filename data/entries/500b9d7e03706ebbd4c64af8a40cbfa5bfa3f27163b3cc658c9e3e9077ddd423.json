The more I think about it, the more I realize it is all about their own social validation and gathering social capital for themselves. After all, unless the introduction has a specific purpose, random intros are mostly about feeding your own ego.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most introductions I make have a specific purpose. Either it is an ask to fulfill a specific need, or, in some cases, it is just to get to know me. The more abstract (or purposeless) an introduction — usually via email — more it shows disrespect for the other person and their time. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I personally make introductions, I ask in advance before making one. I want to be respectful of their time. And more often than not, i keep it simple—direct and actionable. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I don’t want or need is social capital.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>May 16, 2024, San Francisco! </em></strong></p>","author":"Om Malik","siteTitle":"Om Malik","siteHash":"56aa7c22de1a9e5680d03082a2a13db78fe214c96b8119e8d54042cbf2d355ae","entryHash":"500b9d7e03706ebbd4c64af8a40cbfa5bfa3f27163b3cc658c9e3e9077ddd423","category":"default"}
