For example, they seem to list shows not in the order they discovered them, as I do in my products, rather in order of pubDate. So when I set the dates on the shows from 2004 to their actual dates, that would have worked if I hadn't made a <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2024/06/19.html#a151601\">mistake</a> in GMT-encoding the dates. Stupid programmer (me). Now they will show up first in the lists forever unless I switch to that form of dates. This so totally sucks. I wish there were something in RSS to say \"Hey readers dump your cache now, let's start over, because I fcuked up.\" It wouldn't have mattered anyway, I'm sure none of them would listen, right?","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"9b0fd0b94dbca7066ff27825c84aa29af09ddb8888b756bfbde72294f1d10ff1","category":"default"}
