{"title":"Claude Reviews You!","link":"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/903457556/0/marginalrevolution~Claude-Reviews-You.html","date":1724584904000,"content":"<p>I asked Claude to read my post, <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/08/go-for-the-gold.html\">Go for the Gold!</a> on using inequality in the NFL and NBA to get a different perspective on income inequality. I then asked Claude, “Which are the best comments showing they understood the op-ed and responded in a productive and reasonable way either critically or positively?” And following that “Which are the least informed, least useful comments?” Here are Claude’s answers for the best comments and the original comments (no indent on Claude):</p>\r\n<p><strong>Jack of all disciplines</strong> (2024-08-19 09:26:51):</p>\r\n<blockquote><p>The NFL is a clever analogy, but were this not such a small part of the economy we’d surely have fights over value creation, opportunity, and fairness even if we could measure performance in other careers as well as we can in professional athletics. Genes matter a lot for economic outcomes, for example. Is this fair or unfair? We’d be fighting a lot about that question even if we could provide every reasonable opportunity for everyone to increase their human capital to their full potential and could measure one’s contribution to society perfectly.</p></blockquote>\r\n<p>This comment acknowledges the NFL analogy as clever while pointing out its limitations. It expands on the discussion by noting that genetics play a large role in economic outcomes beyond just athletics, raising thoughtful questions about fairness and opportunity that go beyond the original analogy.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Marginalist Corma</strong>c (2024-08-19 11:42:54):</p>\r\n<blockquote><p>The point that most of the comments here are unwilling to accept is a undeniable fact of reality:\r\n<br />\r\nEvery equal society known to man in practice has been way, way poorer than the more unequal societies. Across the board: poorer economically, socially, with more poverty, more resentment, less freedom, less access to health and leisure, less optimistic and less dynamic.\r\n<br />\r\nVoila!</p></blockquote>\r\n<p>While brief, this comment shows understanding of the op-ed’s broader implications. It productively shifts the discussion to empirical outcomes, noting the historical correlation between inequality and overall societal prosperity. This adds a valuable perspective to consider alongside the ethical arguments presented in the original piece.</p>\r\n<p><span><strong>Saturn</strong> (2024-08-19 08:10:08):</span></p>\r\n<blockquote><p>The analogy makes me think that Alex is now sympathetic to strong government, unions and price controls/salary caps. Go Kamala!</p></blockquote>\r\n<p>This comment, while brief, cleverly turns the op-ed’s argument on its head in a thought-provoking way. By suggesting that the NFL analogy actually supports “strong government, unions and price controls/salary caps,” the commenter highlights potential inconsistencies in using the NFL as a model for free-market economics. This response shows a keen understanding of the op-ed’s premise and critically engages with it in a witty and insightful manner.</p>\r\n<p>Alex again: Here are Claude’s answers for the worst comments. In this case I do not include the original comment but I checked and Claude is correct. EdR is usually much better!</p>\r\n<p>It’s much easier to agree on the worst than the best comments. I would have no problem letting Claude delete the worst comments.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Skeptical American</strong> (2024-08-19 08:37:25): This comment attacks Bernie Sanders personally rather than engaging with the content of the op-ed. It uses inflammatory language and makes accusations without providing evidence or constructive criticism. This type of comment doesn’t contribute to a reasoned debate about inequality.</li>\r\n<li><strong>EdR</strong> (2024-08-19 14:26:49): This comment veers off-topic to make personal attacks against Kamala Harris, including unsubstantiated claims about her personal life. It doesn’t address the arguments in the op-ed and instead engages in inflammatory rhetoric that doesn’t contribute to a productive discussion about inequality.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>Hat tip: Robin Hanson who suggested the experiment.</p>\r\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/08/claude-reviews-you.html\">Claude Reviews You!</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com\">Marginal REVOLUTION</a>.</p>\r\n<img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/903457556/0/marginalrevolution\" />\r\n<div><a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/903457556/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/903457556/marginalrevolution,\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/903457556/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/x.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/903457556/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/903457556/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/08/claude-reviews-you.html#comments\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/comments20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/08/claude-reviews-you.html/feed\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/commentsrss20.png\" /></a> \r\n<div><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/08/claude-reviews-you.html#comments\"><h3>Comments</h3></a><ul><li><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/08/claude-reviews-you.html#comment-160803639\">Claudian is the new Straussian</a> <i>by phatllama</i></li><li><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/08/claude-reviews-you.html#comment-160803638\">Aw, shucks.
