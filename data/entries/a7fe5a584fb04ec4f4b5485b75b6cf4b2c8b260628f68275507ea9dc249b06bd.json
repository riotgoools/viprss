This gender disparity is compounded by a political tilt: 27% of news influencers explicitly identify as conservative, significantly outnumbering the 21% who lean liberal—a gap that balloons on platforms like Facebook, where right-leaning influencers outnumber left-leaning ones by a staggering three-to-one ratio. 39% of news influencers explicitly identify as conservative on Facebook, compared with just 13% who identify as liberal.</p><div><figure><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F991b7d8c-3f0a-4be5-9e5f-f593a0d9ffc9_434x604.png\"><div><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F991b7d8c-3f0a-4be5-9e5f-f593a0d9ffc9_434x604.png\" width=\"286\" height=\"398.02764976958525\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F991b7d8c-3f0a-4be5-9e5f-f593a0d9ffc9_434x604.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F991b7d8c-3f0a-4be5-9e5f-f593a0d9ffc9_434x604.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F991b7d8c-3f0a-4be5-9e5f-f593a0d9ffc9_434x604.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F991b7d8c-3f0a-4be5-9e5f-f593a0d9ffc9_434x604.png 1456w\" /><div></div></div></a><figcaption>Source: Pew Research</figcaption></figure></div><p>In a media environment where about <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/journalism/2024/11/18/americas-news-influencers/\">4 in 10 adults under 30 regularly get news from news content creators</a>, this imbalance isn’t just inequitable—it’s a systemic distortion of public discourse that ultimately undermines democratic values, entrenches conservative messaging, and accelerates polarization. I've written before about <a href=\"https://www.usermag.co/p/why-democrats-wont-build-their-own\">how desperately the left needs to build an infrastructure to amass online influence</a>, these stats highlight just how urgent that mission is.</p><p>Over the past two decades, as I outlined in my book,<em> <a href=\"https://www.extremelyonlinebook.com/\">Extremely Online: The Untold Story of Fame, Influence, and Power on the Internet</a></em>, our media ecosystem has become fragmented and entirely reoriented around online influence. Content creators are directly reshaping how millions of people understand the world and they largely come from outside traditional journalism. Just 23% of news influencers studied were currently or previously ever employed by a news organization. </p><p>Though Pew doesn't go into detail on why news influencers skew male and conservative, there are several factors feeding this slant. Though right-leaning content creators constantly accuse mainstream platforms of censoring their views, data definitively proves otherwise: conservative voices are consistently amplified across social media <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/17/24298669/musk-trump-endorsement-x-boosting-republican-posts-july-algorithm-change\">platforms, especially X</a> (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/oct/22/twitter-admits-bias-in-algorithm-for-rightwing-politicians-and-news-outlets\">even before Elon</a>)<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/09/26/facebook-conservatives-2020-421146\"> and Facebook</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.usermag.co/subscribe?\"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p>Countless studies have proved this over the years, but a 2021 report published by <a href=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5b6df958f8370af3217d4178/t/6011e68dec2c7013d3caf3cb/1611785871154/NYU+False+Accusation+report_FINAL.pdf\">the NYU Stern Center for Business and Human Rights</a>, from disinformation expert Paul Barrett and researcher J Grant Sims offers one of the most detailed debunkings. It found that claims of anti-conservative bias on social media are themselves “a form of disinformation: a falsehood with no reliable evidence to support it”.</p><p>Still, according to a 2020 study by the Pew Research Center, 90% of Republicans believe that their views are being censored online, and 69% of Republicans believe social media companies “generally support the views of liberals over conservatives.\"</p><p>“There is no evidence to support the claim that the major social media companies are suppressing, censoring or otherwise discriminating against conservatives on their platforms,” said Barrett, the disinformation researcher who worked on the report. “In fact, it is often conservatives who gain the <em>most</em> in terms of engagement and online attention, thanks to the platforms’ systems of algorithmic promotion of content.” Across social media, right wing content receives regular amplification <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/10/16/instagram-limits-political-content-shadowban-election-posts/\">while left wing content is suppressed</a>. </p><div><figure><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd333dc60-58d6-434c-ab76-fc85d043439e_680x482.png\"><div><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd333dc60-58d6-434c-ab76-fc85d043439e_680x482.png\" width=\"426\" height=\"301.95882352941175\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd333dc60-58d6-434c-ab76-fc85d043439e_680x482.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd333dc60-58d6-434c-ab76-fc85d043439e_680x482.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd333dc60-58d6-434c-ab76-fc85d043439e_680x482.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd333dc60-58d6-434c-ab76-fc85d043439e_680x482.png 1456w\" loading=\"lazy\" /><div></div></div></a><figcaption>Source: Pew Research</figcaption></figure></div><p>Social media platforms have also long boosted men's voices over women’s.

Unlike Facebook, YouTube, X, and Instagram, where men dominate the influencer space, TikTok has the smallest gender gap, with 50% of its news influencers being men and 45% being women.</p><div><figure><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4fcb7abc-765d-48ff-9dbb-1cdebf48fe35_862x688.png\"><div><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4fcb7abc-765d-48ff-9dbb-1cdebf48fe35_862x688.png\" width=\"440\" height=\"351.18329466357307\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4fcb7abc-765d-48ff-9dbb-1cdebf48fe35_862x688.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4fcb7abc-765d-48ff-9dbb-1cdebf48fe35_862x688.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4fcb7abc-765d-48ff-9dbb-1cdebf48fe35_862x688.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4fcb7abc-765d-48ff-9dbb-1cdebf48fe35_862x688.png 1456w\" loading=\"lazy\" /><div></div></div></a><figcaption>Source: Pew Research</figcaption></figure></div><p>Politically, TikTok also bucks the trend: it’s the only platform where right-leaning news influencers (25%) do not outnumber left-leaning ones (28%). TikTok also has a higher concentration of news content creators who identify as LGBTQ+ or advocate for LGBTQ+ rights (13%), which is more than double the proportion on other platforms. </p><p>As I've written previously, TikTok <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/06/13/influencers-biden-tiktok-ban/\">remains a hub for progressive activism online</a>. But unfortunately, this has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/mar/16/tiktok-ban-progressive-politics-activism\">made the app the target of right wing ire and directly fed efforts to shut it down</a>. </p><p>Overall, Pew's findings paint a concerning picture of the new online news landscape. The widespread dominance of conservative male voices in the news content creator world tilts public discourse toward reactionary right wing narratives, which are then boosted by algorithms that reward sensationalism and outrage.</p><p>As millions of young people turn to content creators for news, these gender and ideological disparities must be addressed. If we don't fight for change and build systems to amplify more women and progressive voices online, we will be stuck with a media landscape that continues to exacerbate inequality and warps our political landscape for the worse.</p><div><div><div><p>User Mag is a 100% reader-supported publication.
