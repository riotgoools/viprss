A major world wide hub like Atlanta, London or Dubai. Bluesky is a regional airport in a cool place, maybe Austin. Mastodon is a small network of airports, like the ones served by Ryanair in Europe. </p>\n<p>Threads is potentially one of the big airports like the one Musk bought, but it's not as much of a hub yet. Orlando? Frankfurt? </p>\n<p>There are lots of scheduled flights in and out of X because it's where most of the traffic already goes. It's quite possibly not running that smoothly, like perhaps JFK in NYC, always a mess, under construction, huge traffic, broken systems. </p>\n<p>But it does actually work pretty reliably most of the time. </p>\n<p>When I was first getting started in tech, when we got the initial angel funding for LVT, I asked the lead investor, Bill Jordan, if Apple was going to go out of business. At the time, 1983, a lot of people said it would. He asked what their sales were. $1 billion, I said. </p>\n<p>He said they're not going away. He said companies that large don't disappear. After 40 years of experience in tech since then, Bill was right. Companies that lead markets very rarely disappear. It does happen. But not often. More likely is Musk will right the ship, and it will grow to completely dominate the market. Threads will possibly be Pepsi. Mastodon will be Home Depot. Bluesky will be Laurel Canyon. Or who knows? </p>\n<p>But there's a high probability that Musk's company will exist in some form, and make us feel sick, every day, about what it could have been. ðŸ˜€</p>\n<p>BTW, the Wikipedia <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_Videotext\">page</a> for Living Videotext begins with one of our slogans. It was a joke, and meant to keep us humble, so we listen to users. It was one of many such slogans. LVT made some important contributions to the networks we use today. Wikipedia should talk about that first, show some respect, for crying out loud. Otherwise, except for that snipe up front, the account is actually pretty accurate. </p>","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"06fc65a84df633029680e28ebfafc7baeddb4adb5d1358dad088129be4ba5e9a","category":"default"}
