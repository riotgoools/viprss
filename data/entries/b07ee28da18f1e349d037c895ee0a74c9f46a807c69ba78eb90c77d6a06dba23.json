My father <i>never</i> rolled around on the floor, before or after. But I liked seeing him let go just that once. </li>\n<li>Another with my father. When the Beatles were on Ed Sullivan he said they were wearing wigs. He knew that because no man would actually have hair like that. I was 8 or 9 years old and remember telling him I didn't think he got that right.</li>\n<li>I remember exactly where I was when Neil Armstrong walked on the moon. At the Newport Folk Festival and about 500 people were watching a tiny TV on top of a VW bus. Somehow everyone could see. It was outdoors and it was silent, everyone was in awe.</li>\n<li>One that's only peripherally about TV. I remember every time I went to see a game at Shea Stadium as a kid I was blown away by the color, because most of the Mets games I saw were on TV, in black and white. </li>\n<li>Here's one from adulthood. Watching Barack Obama give his victory speech on election night in 2008 in my house in Berkeley with a group of friends, with tears running down all our faces.</li>\n</ol>","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"b07ee28da18f1e349d037c895ee0a74c9f46a807c69ba78eb90c77d6a06dba23","category":"Sites"}
