The first was perhaps even more miraculous. At the turn of the 19th century, under the Meiji Restoration, Japan transformed itself almost overnight from a peasant economy to an industrial powerhouse.</p>\r\n<blockquote><p>After centuries of resisting economic and social change, Japan transformed from a relatively poor, predominantly agricultural economy specialized in the exports of unprocessed, primary products to an economy specialized in the export of manufactures <em>in under fifteen years</em>.</p></blockquote>\r\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w32667/w32667.pdf\">remarkable new paper</a>, Juhász, Sakabe, and Weinstein show how the key to this transformation was a massive effort to translate and codify technical information in the Japanese language. This state-led initiative made cutting-edge industrial knowledge accessible to Japanese entrepreneurs and workers in a way that was unparalleled among non-Western countries at the time.</p>\r\n<p>Here’s an amazing graph which tells much of the story. In both 1870 and 1910 most of the technical knowledge of the world is in French, English, Italian and German but look at what happens in Japan–basically no technical books in 1870 to on par with English in 1910. Moreover, <em>no other country did this</em>.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Tech-Books-1.png\" width=\"943\" height=\"714\" srcset=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Tech-Books-1.png 1187w, https://marginalrevolution.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Tech-Books-1-300x227.png 300w, https://marginalrevolution.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Tech-Books-1-1024x776.png 1024w, https://marginalrevolution.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Tech-Books-1-768x582.png 768w\" /></p>\r\n<p>Translating a technical document today is much easier than in the past because the words already exist. Translating technical documents in the late 19th century, however, required the creation and standardization of entirely new words.</p>\r\n<blockquote><p>…the Institute of Barbarian Books (Bansho Torishirabesho)…was tasked with developing English-Japanese dictionaries to facilitate technical translations. This project was the first step in what would become a massive government effort to codify and absorb Western science. Linguists and lexicographers have written extensively on the difficulty of scientific translation, which explains why little codification of knowledge happened in languages other than English and its close cognates: French and German (c.f. Kokawa et al. 1994; Lippert 2001; Clark 2009). The linguistic problem was two-fold. First, no words existed in Japanese for canonical Industrial Revolution products such as the railroad, steam engine, or telegraph, and using phonetic representations of all untranslatable jargon in a technical book resulted in transliteration of the text, not translation. Second, translations needed to be standardized so that all translators would translate a given foreign word into the same Japanese one.</p>\r\n<p>Solving these two problems became one of the Institute’s main objectives.</p></blockquote>\r\n<p>Here’s a graph showing the creation of new words in Japan by year. You can see the explosion in new words in the late 19th century. Note that this happened well after the Perry Mission. The words didn’t simply evolve the authors argue they were created as a form of industrial policy).</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/New-Words.png\" width=\"848\" height=\"650\" srcset=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/New-Words.png 848w, https://marginalrevolution.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/New-Words-300x230.png 300w, https://marginalrevolution.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/New-Words-768x589.png 768w\" /></p>\r\n<p>By the way, AstralCodexTen points us to an <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/your-book-review-autobiography-of\">interesting biography</a> of a translator at the time who works on economics books:</p>\r\n<blockquote><p>[Fukuzawa] makes great progress on a number of translations. Among them is the first Western economics book translated into Japanese. In the course of this work, he encounters difficulties with the concept of “competition.” He decides to coin a new Japanese word, <em>kyoso</em>, derived from the words for “race and fight.” His patron, a Confucian, is unimpressed with this translation. He suggests other renderings. Why not “love of the nation shown in connection with trade”? Or “open generosity from a merchant in times of national stress”? But Fukuzawa insists on <em>kyoso</em>, and now the word is the first result on Google Translate.</p></blockquote>\r\n<p>There is <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w32667/w32667.pdf\">a lot more</a> in this paper. In particular, showing how the translation of documents lead to productivity growth on an industry by industry basis and a demonstration of the importance of this mechanism for economic growth across the world.</p>\r\n<p>The bottom line for me is this: What caused the industrial revolution is a perennial question–was it coal, freedom, literacy?–but this is the first paper which gives what I think is a truly compelling answer. Japan’s rapid industrialization under the Meiji Restoration was driven by its unprecedented effort to translate, codify, and disseminate Western technical knowledge in the Japanese language.</p>\r\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/07/not-lost-in-translation-how-barbarian-books-laid-the-foundation-for-japans-industrial-revoluton.html\">Not Lost In Translation: How Barbarian Books Laid the Foundation for Japan’s Industrial Revoluton</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com\">Marginal REVOLUTION</a>.</p>\r\n<img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/901556525/0/marginalrevolution\" />\r\n<div><a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/901556525/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/901556525/marginalrevolution,https%3a%2f%2fmarginalrevolution.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2024%2f07%2fTech-Books-1.png\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/901556525/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/x.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/901556525/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/901556525/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/07/not-lost-in-translation-how-barbarian-books-laid-the-foundation-for-japans-industrial-revoluton.html#comments\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/comments20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/07/not-lost-in-translation-how-barbarian-books-laid-the-foundation-for-japans-industrial-revoluton.html/feed\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/commentsrss20.png\" /></a> \r\n<div><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/07/not-lost-in-translation-how-barbarian-books-laid-the-foundation-for-japans-industrial-revoluton.html#comments\"><h3>Comments</h3></a><ul><li><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/07/not-lost-in-translation-how-barbarian-books-laid-the-foundation-for-japans-industrial-revoluton.html#comment-160785494\">“State capacity”</a> <i>by M</i></li></ul></div><h3>Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/07/my-excellent-conversation-with-brian-winter.html?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=my-excellent-conversation-with-brian-winter\">My excellent Conversation with Brian Winter</a></li><li><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/07/every-stock-is-a-vaccine-stock-revisited.html?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=every-stock-is-a-vaccine-stock-revisited\">Every Stock is a Vaccine Stock, Revisited</a></li><li><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/07/emile-zolas-the-ladies-paradise-les-rougon-macquart-11.html?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=emile-zolas-the-ladies-paradise-les-rougon-macquart-11\">Emile Zola’s The Ladies’ Paradise Reviewed by Furman</a></li></ul> </div>","author":"Alex Tabarrok","siteTitle":"Marginal Revolution","siteHash":"242a3a39129b36e0c574c3796ca7ef3cf8af967286c2998fabf7240d1ad52a47","entryHash":"d032a13c01e7c04d348ef7ac8a42e12e25bdc197af7e8bc318f15160284b1ab1","category":"default"}
