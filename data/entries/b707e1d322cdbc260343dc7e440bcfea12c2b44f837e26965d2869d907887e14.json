You get a hard-to-understand error message from MySQL, so you send the code to ChatGPT and it gives you a perfect error message, and gives you the corrected code. It also can generate SQL from an actual English language description. Quite a loop-close, since SQL was sold as programming in English, just like COBOL or AppleScript, except in ChatGPT you really are using English. It's precise English, but not \"marketing\" English (ie non-technical managers can be fooled by what they see). An intelligent non-programmer could actually write code, not sure of that of course since I am a programmer myself.","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"b707e1d322cdbc260343dc7e440bcfea12c2b44f837e26965d2869d907887e14","category":"default"}
