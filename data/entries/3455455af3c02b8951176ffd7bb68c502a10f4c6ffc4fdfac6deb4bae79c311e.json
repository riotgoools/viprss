Yes, some people are still meeting and making friends through social media, but most of what consumers are looking for, especially from brands or media companies, is to be entertained.</p><p>66% of social users find “edutainment” (content that educates and entertains) to be the most engaging of all brand content. Even more so than memes, serialized content, or skits, Sprout Social found.</p><p>When it comes to platforms, Instagram dominates. 84% of social users have an Instagram profile (the most of all of the networks) and 69% of social media users say they see the most engaging brand content on Instagram, while 44% wish brands used Instagram even more often, the highest of any platform.</p><div><figure><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6ef8b7d5-5bf5-4c5f-91f9-7922d650057d_2480x1396.png\"><div><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6ef8b7d5-5bf5-4c5f-91f9-7922d650057d_2480x1396.png\" width=\"1456\" height=\"820\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6ef8b7d5-5bf5-4c5f-91f9-7922d650057d_2480x1396.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6ef8b7d5-5bf5-4c5f-91f9-7922d650057d_2480x1396.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6ef8b7d5-5bf5-4c5f-91f9-7922d650057d_2480x1396.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6ef8b7d5-5bf5-4c5f-91f9-7922d650057d_2480x1396.png 1456w\" /><div><div><div></div><div></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>YouTube is also a crucial platform that will continue to grow in relevance in 2025, especially following the imminent TikTok ban. </p><p>More than three-quarters (78%) of all social users have a YouTube profile, and that number is even higher among Gen Z and Millennials. The platform's long videos continue to appeal, even when it comes to brand posts. Over 50% of YouTube users prefer brand content longer than 60 seconds, making it a bit of an outlier in a landscape dominated bite-sized media. This preference underscores YouTube’s role as a destination for deep dives, whether it’s tutorials, storytelling, or educational content.</p><p>Meanwhile, TikTok still dominates as a cultural engine and product discovery hub. With 68% of social users (rising to 86% among Gen Z) maintaining profiles, TikTok has become more than just a social network, it’s a search engine, a news source, and a marketplace. </p><p>Nearly 54% of TikTok users interact with brand content daily, mostly via short-form videos. The platform’s ability to turn even technical or niche topics into relatable, shareable content is best exemplified by brands like Cisco, which use humor and creativity to demystify their products. For brands, the lesson is clear: TikTok rewards relatability and boldness.</p><div><figure><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7646f80b-bc64-404b-9540-d94817aea40c_990x678.png\"><div><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7646f80b-bc64-404b-9540-d94817aea40c_990x678.png\" width=\"596\" height=\"408.169696969697\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7646f80b-bc64-404b-9540-d94817aea40c_990x678.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7646f80b-bc64-404b-9540-d94817aea40c_990x678.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7646f80b-bc64-404b-9540-d94817aea40c_990x678.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7646f80b-bc64-404b-9540-d94817aea40c_990x678.png 1456w\" loading=\"lazy\" /><div><div><div></div><div></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Pinterest is an app that we don’t hear about often, it’s usually overlooked, but this report showed that it still offers a unique value proposition.

Despite its tumultuous ownership transition, 48% of social users maintain profiles on X, and text posts continue to dominate engagement on there. Brands like Aldi UK have succeeded on X by blending humor and cultural commentary into their content. </p><p>Looking to 2025, it's clear that no matter what platform, users want to be entertained and educated. There is a demand for quality (especially more longform content) over quantity, and a growing importance on authenticity. </p><p>I think this next year on social will be one where people seek to form deeper, more meaningful connections across an increasingly fragmented social landscape. I think the short form boom is fading, and live streaming and richer forms of interactive content are ascendent. </p><p>People are also recognizing that you don't have to be everywhere at once. While it's crucial to diversify and not rely solely on one platform, there are officially too many platforms to keep up with all at once. As Sprout Social notes in the conclusion of their report, to succeed on social in 2025, you don’t have to do everything, everywhere all at once. Just show up in the places that matter, and focus on those deeper, more meaningful connections. </p><p><a href=\"https://www.usermag.co/subscribe?\"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><h2>How a wonky little gingerbread man became the internet’s holiday icon</h2><div><figure><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89c519ba-198e-4ebb-a0a3-f1f9fc952d90_1310x764.png\"><div><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89c519ba-198e-4ebb-a0a3-f1f9fc952d90_1310x764.png\" width=\"1310\" height=\"764\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89c519ba-198e-4ebb-a0a3-f1f9fc952d90_1310x764.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89c519ba-198e-4ebb-a0a3-f1f9fc952d90_1310x764.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89c519ba-198e-4ebb-a0a3-f1f9fc952d90_1310x764.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89c519ba-198e-4ebb-a0a3-f1f9fc952d90_1310x764.png 1456w\" loading=\"lazy\" /><div><div><div></div><div></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Gen Z internet users are feral right now for <a href=\"https://shop.ty.com/product/cookie/43118.html\">this little a gingerbread man Beanie Baby</a> named Cookie with giant, slightly melancholy eyes, a red button nose, and a wonky smile. </p><p>Cookie, a plushie created by Ty Inc., exploded into the holiday zeitgeist after going viral on X.
