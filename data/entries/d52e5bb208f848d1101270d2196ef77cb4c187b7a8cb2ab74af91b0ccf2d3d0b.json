As you can imagine, there's still a lot to do.</p>\n<p>Here's a list of what you can currently do as a user:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>import/export domains (a template is provided<a href=\"https://beachfront.digital/downloads/beachfront-digital-import.csv\">2</a> for importing).</li>\n<li>add domains and registrar/expiration info will automatically get\nadded (in most cases)</li>\n<li>add wishlist domains</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Not a huge list but I think the main draw will be the personal analytics. To my\nknowledge, no other registrar does this and they <em>certainly</em> don't allow you to\nsee the domains you have registered elsewhere. Here is what you can expect to\nsee after adding domains:</p>\n<p>ðŸ“¸<a href=\"https://%F0%9F%94%A5.pixels.wtf/blog/image/2017/v2-of-beachfront-digital-is-live-c.png\">Analytical shot of BeachfrontDigital</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>a conversational readout of your domain portfolio<ul>\n<li>total number of domains</li>\n<li>number of domains renewing this month</li>\n<li>number of domains renewing this year</li>\n<li>number of domains renewing next year</li>\n<li>total number of TLDs (the text after the period in URLs, <code>.com</code>, <code>.net</code>,\n<code>.space</code>, &amp;c)</li>\n<li>total number of registrars (the companies you buy your domains from)</li>\n<li>your favorite registrar</li>\n<li>your favorite TLD</li>\n<li>total amount of money you're spending annually to renew your domains</li>\n<li>your cheapest domain</li>\n<li>your most expensive domain</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>ðŸ“¸<a href=\"https://%F0%9F%94%A5.pixels.wtf/blog/image/2017/v2-of-beachfront-digital-is-live-d.png\">Another analytical shot of BeachfrontDigital</a></p>\n<p>You can also see this data in chart form, which is arguably <em>much</em> more\nimpressive-looking. Currently, the visual data displays:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the number of domain renewals occurring per month</li>\n<li>the amount of money you're paying per month</li>\n<li>the amount of money you pay each registrar per year</li>\n<li>the number of domains you've registered per registrar</li>\n<li>the amount of domains you own per TLD</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Those screenshots above are from my own domain portfolio and I can gleam some\ninteresting information from the dataâ€¦</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I already knew this, but most of my domains come from Tucows, the parent\ncompany of Hover.</li>\n<li>Three times a year, I seem to get a burst of inspiration and buy domain\nnames. Also, I need to check what month it is before buying something\nextravagant.</li>\n<li>My favorite TLDs are <code>.online</code> and <code>.com</code> (my first domain name was\n<code>pw-software.com</code> and it's still live to this day).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Anyhoo, all this to say that V2 of BeachfrontDigital is live and available at\nbeachfront.digital<a href=\"https://beachfront.digital\">3</a>.
