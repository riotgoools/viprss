{"title":"New Jolene Lyrics","link":"https://kottke.org/24/04/new-jolene-lyrics","date":1712259047000,"content":"\n        <p>I’ve always been intrigued by the “Jolene” lyrics (are they <a href=\"https://kottke.org/23/11/0043527-dolly-parton-on-jolene-to\">mature or are they insane</a>?), so I was excited to hear Beyoncé’s <a href=\"https://genius.com/Beyonce-jolene-lyrics\">version</a>. Ultimately those lyrics didn’t really speak to me, but then I <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/glynnisfawkes/\">came across</a> novelist <a href=\"https://www.sonorajha.com/\">Sonora Jha</a>’s twist on the “Jolene” lyrics on Instagram, and I felt an itch had been scratched. I’ve transcribed those lyrics below — her <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/C5UIoV5RTWu/\">original post is here</a>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>(With apologies to Dolly and Beyoncé)<br />\nJolene Jolene Jolene Jolene<br />\nI’m watchin’ you move in on my man<br />\nJolene Jolene Jolene Jolene<br />\nI’m sayin you should say “I think I can”<br />\n<p></p>\nYou’re beautiful beyond compare<br />\nI hope you’ll pardon while I stare<br />\nJust wonderin’ what moisturizer you wear, Jolene<br />\nBut good for you, oh good for you<br />\nYou can have my man and my children too<br />\nJolene<br />\n<p></p>\nDon’t get me wrong, I love my man I love those kids as hard I can<br />\nBut some days I could just, you know what I mean<br />\nJolene<br />\nAnd if my man’s that easy to take<br />\nYou can have him and also eat your cake Jolene<br />\n<p></p>\nJolene Jolene Jolene Jolene<br />\nI’m livin’ my best life and wish the same for you<br />\nJolene<br />\nYou freed up my every other weekend<br />\nFor me to spend with my supercool friends<br />\nI love how you stepmom my kids, Jolene<br /> \n<p></p>\nI hope he’s showerin’ love on you<br />\nThe way I tried to teach him to<br />\nYou’re welcome, you’re welcome, you Queen Jolene<br />\n<p></p>\nYou say you don’t want him no more<br />\nBut please don’t leave him at my door<br />\nJust tell me where to Venmo you, Jolene<br />\n<p></p>\nJolene Jolene Jolene Jolene<br />\nYou could have your choice of men<br />\nAnd I’m wonderin’ if I’ll bother to love again<br />\nSo l’II do me and you do you Jolene<br />\n<p></p>\nJolene Jolene Jolene Jolene<br />\nThe kids are grown and happy too<br />\nI love how you found a better boo<br />\nLet’s all just move on, okay, please, Jolene<br />\n</blockquote>\n\n <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Beyonc%C3%A9\">Beyoncé</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Dolly%20Parton\">Dolly Parton</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Jolene\">Jolene</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/lyrics\">lyrics</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/music\">music</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Sonora%20Jha\">Sonora Jha</a></p>\n\n <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/04/new-jolene-lyrics\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Edith Zimmerman","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"3ce04ee48d17c52d4c286a490f3dc6d0a91af598f5f46d91448b2afdd49a2807","category":"default"}
