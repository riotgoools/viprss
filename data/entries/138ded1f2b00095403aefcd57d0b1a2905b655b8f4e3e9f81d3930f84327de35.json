TikTok and YouTube seem to have mastered this concept, but there’s one place online where the conventional rules of social media don’t seem to apply: Instagram Reels. </p><p>On Instagram Reels, the weirdest stuff and the most random people will pop into your feed with no rhyme or reason.

She did not. This rumor was <a href=\"https://x.com/TaraBull808/status/1833709773168259290\">started by users on X</a> and quickly spread across Instagram and other social platforms. </p><p>When it became clear that there were major visual differences between the Tiffany &amp; Co. earrings Harris was likely wearing and the alleged <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/nova.audioearrings/?hl=en\">Nova H1 Audio Earrings</a> that she was definitely not wearing, conspiracy theorists pivoted again. </p><p>Right wing podcaster <a href=\"https://x.com/EoinHiggins_/status/1834199009243676992\">Bret Weinstein</a> and some of his supporters are now claiming that it was all an intentional 4d chess move to “trap” them into believing a falsehood, which, of course, he’s careful to say that he’s not even sure is false (it is false). \"We are now being targeted in order to make us jump at things that aren't real,” he tells his followers. </p><p>What Weinstein is doing here is a tactic that conspiracy theorists are relying more and more on. When easily disprovable conspiracies are proved false, they pivot to claiming that their confusion was <em>intentional</em>, it was manufactured as part of some secretive grand plan to distract the masses. These sorts of beliefs were always core to the QAnon movement, but I feel like we’re seeing them more and more as real time fact checking ramps up and people wall themselves off and build their own realities online. </p><div><div><div><p>Thanks for reading!
