Then I'd ask why is every object in class <code>trBlogrollFeed</code> 31 pixels high? By my computation it should be 27 pixels. Where are the extra pixels coming from? It matters. For a comparison, the same structure on <a href=\"https://blogroll.social/\">this page</a> renders at 27.5 pixels which looks just right, but it's weird that it computes it's got that extra half pixel. I don't really believe in half-pixels. Hey if you have any ideas, post a note <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/300\">here</a>.","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"6a3772172fd046537387a609a3d1cf5f03f3b81090ef177861ec7f4d1b3dc03c","category":"default"}
