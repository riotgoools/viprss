{"title":"","link":"http://scripting.com/2024/12/18.html#a160909","date":1734538149000,"content":"<img src=\"https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/06/14/julieAndrews.png\" />I've got a new project called <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/davegpt\">davegpt</a>, it's in GitHub, open source of course. I also created a <a href=\"https://help.openai.com/en/articles/10169521-using-projects-in-chatgpt\">ChatGPT project</a> with the same code. Presumably I can ask it questions about the code. Because I have a <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/davegpt/blob/main/worknotes.md\">worknotes.md</a> file in the GitHub project, ChatGPT understands where I want to take this project. Most amazing, it wrote a <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/davegpt/blob/main/gptnotes.md\">summary</a> of what it saw in the project. I <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/davegpt/blob/main/gptnotes.md\">added that</a> to the GitHub project, of course, and since it was in Markdown, it fit right in with no mods. The power of standards. I love it when things that should work, do. The next step is to implement a feature in the new Bingeworthy that can only be done with an AI bot like ChatGPT. It's such a thrill to be working on this stuff as it's happening. And what a delight that it has an API. I don't mind that I'm paying for it, I love the idea of paying to break down walls to create new things that couldn't have been created before.","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"b9d96c1647adcb6816df5e72186b50abcba867b5d0ee96abea6b5fbf01368c18","category":"Sites"}
