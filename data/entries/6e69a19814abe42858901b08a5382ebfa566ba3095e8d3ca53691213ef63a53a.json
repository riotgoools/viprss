I got this from Todd Vaziri, a visual effects artist at ILM, <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/tvaziri.com/post/3kmwcc6oa2v2e\">who says</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>If youâ€™re at all interested in visual effects, you gotta watch this Academy presentation that took place last weekend. It goes in-depth with all five nominees, and shows before/after material that hasnâ€™t been seen publicly.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>The meat of the program begins at around 24 minutes when they start showing visual effects reels from the nominated films (The Creator, Godzilla Minus One, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, Mission: Impossible â€“ Dead Reckoning Part One, Napoleon), followed by a discussion with the members of the effects teams.</p>\n\n<p>The Academy has several other nominee programs available on YouTube (including <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnK1AYgO1q0\">animated feature films</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHnqFoWIBbk\">documentary feature films</a>) and more to come in the next few days (including <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dusfWNGn1Fs\">best picture</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc9qB93gfrU\">international feature films</a>). What a trove of material for film lovers.</p>\n\n <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/best%20of\">best of</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/best%20of%202024\">best of 2024</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/film%20school\">film school</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/movies\">movies</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Oscars\">Oscars</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/video\">video</a></p>\n\n <p>ðŸ’¬ <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/03/visual-effects-oscar-nominees-go-in-depth-on-their-work\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> â†’</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"6e69a19814abe42858901b08a5382ebfa566ba3095e8d3ca53691213ef63a53a","category":"default"}
