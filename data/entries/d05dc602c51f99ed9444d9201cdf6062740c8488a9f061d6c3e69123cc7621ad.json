{"title":"Twitter","link":"https://blog.webb.page/2024-12-16-twitter.txt","date":1734307200000,"content":"<p>I've been unbanned from Twitter.</p>\n<p>Since my ban<a href=\"/2023-07-17-twitter.txt\">1</a>, I've spent time periodically attempting to appeal said ban and\neven going as far to use an online postal service<a href=\"https://docupost.com\">2</a> to formally request\nmy data from Twitter's Data Protection Officer.</p>\n<p>I've been on Twitter for 15 years. The thought of all that data being locked\nbehind bullshit was infuriating. Anyhoo, last week I received this email:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Hello,</p>\n<p>We’re writing to let you know that we've unsuspended your account. We’re sorry\nfor the inconvenience and hope to see you back on X soon.</p>\n<p>A little background: we have systems that find and remove multiple automated\nspam accounts in bulk, and yours was flagged as spam by mistake. Please note\nthat it may take an hour or so for your follower and following numbers to\nreturn to normal.</p>\n<p>If you need to get in touch with us again, please file a report through your X\napp or our forms page, as this account isn’t monitored for replies.</p>\n<p>Thanks,</p>\n<p>X Support</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Honestly, I don't believe this…especially when this \"error\" was discovered the\nsame day The Guardian reported<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2024/dec/11/from-x-to-bluesky-why-are-people-abandoning-twitter-digital-town-square\">3</a> on the mass exodus from ElonNet. I think\nTwitter looked at their numbers and thought, \"Our metrics are looking dreadful,\"\nand figured unbanning the banned would make us ever so grateful to be allowed in\nthat our usage of Twitter would return to pre-Elon levels. Furthermore, you\nvisit Twitter today and you'll find plenty of spam accounts within five minutes\nof scrolling.</p>\n<p>Nah.</p>\n<p>After the election<a href=\"/2024-11-06-election.txt\">4</a>, I deleted my remaining Twitter accounts. I literally have\nno reason to remain on the platform.</p>\n<p>Though I gotta admit, having access to my account again and seeing tweets from\nthe people I follow who haven't yet aborted felt quite nice. It felt familiar.\nWhen I tabbed over to the \"For You\" feed though, reality set in. There's no\nsaving this place, it's time to move on.</p>\n<p>I also sent complaints to the Public Inquiry Unit of the Office of the\nAttorney General and got a response from them and Twitter the same day:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Hello,</p>\n<p>We are responding to your request for information regarding account,\n@NetOpWibby. You can download the information with this URL:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://records.twitter.com/disclaimer/randomLettersAndNumbers\">https://records.twitter.com/disclaimer/randomLettersAndNumbers</a></p>\n<p>The URL is valid for the next 7 days. You may download the information a total\nof three times. A brief explanation of the information is included with\nthe download.</p>\n<p>Additionally, your account has been reinstated, as it was suspended\nmistakenly. Accordingly, you can also download your data in your X account\nsettings: <a href=\"https://help.x.com/en/managing-your-account/accessing-your-x-data\">https://help.x.com/en/managing-your-account/accessing-your-x-data</a></p>\n<p>Best,</p>\n<p>X Corp</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Downloading your export from <code>records.twitter.com</code> is excrutiatingly slow. I\nrecommend doing so from a desktop computer because it'll take hours. However,\ndownloading an export from the Twitter UI is quite fast and will finish in under\n10 minutes (for me). Interestingly, the former export will put your tweets in a\nsingle TXT file in JSON format with a PGP key at the top. The latter export will\nprovide you with an HTML file so you can view your tweets in a browser.</p>\n<p>Anyhoo, after I downloaded both exports I ran tweetXer<a href=\"https://github.com/lucahammer/tweetXer\">5</a> by Luca Hammer<a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/luca.run\">6</a> to\ndelete my content from the platform. The great thing about tweetXer is that it\nhas a button that exports your bookmarks, something the official exports\ndon't provide. The deletion process took maybe an hour and some change.</p>\n<p>I haven't deleted this last account yet. Why? I'm not sure. Maybe it's to\nprotect my username from being used maliciously? Maybe there's a chance Elon\nwill get ousted? Maybe I'm being sentimental? Idk. I logged out. Most of the\npeople I follow are active on other platforms so I'm not missing anything.</p>\n<p>Some great perks to finally having my data is that 1) I can stop obsessing over\nnot having it, 2) I can host my tweets<a href=\"https://github.com/tweetback/tweetback-canonical\">7</a>, and 3) I can train a local LLM on 15\nyears of content!</p>\n<p>So long, Twitter! My online presence is fragmented due to your impending death\nbut that no longer bothers me. After all, we used to have accounts across\nseveral forums and other online communities. Nature is healing.</p>\n<p>Rebirth of an era. 🕸️</p>\n<hr />\n","author":"","siteTitle":"the webb blog","siteHash":"d87386c8de21b16d23a4d22ceb0991728c5b4e4486d627490c6fcde14e563300","entryHash":"d05dc602c51f99ed9444d9201cdf6062740c8488a9f061d6c3e69123cc7621ad","category":"Sites"}
