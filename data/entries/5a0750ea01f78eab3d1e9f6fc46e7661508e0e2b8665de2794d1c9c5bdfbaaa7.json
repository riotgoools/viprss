LIFE staff photographer Ralph Crane came to the set and took pictures of the costumed actors in the mall, trying on shoes and making eyes at the lingerie store display, as well as eating in the mess hall with their masks half off. The pictures make for easy laughs, capturing the kind of shenanigans that help liven up a fourth Apes film in as many years.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>(via <a href=\"https://www.danielgray.com/\">daniel benneworthâ€“gray</a>)</p>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/movies\">movies</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/photography\">photography</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Planet%20of%20the%20Apes\">Planet of the Apes</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Ralph%20Crane\">Ralph Crane</a></p>\n\n         <p>ðŸ’¬ <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/05/planet-of-the-apes-goes-to-a-70s-mall\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> â†’</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"5a0750ea01f78eab3d1e9f6fc46e7661508e0e2b8665de2794d1c9c5bdfbaaa7","category":"default"}
