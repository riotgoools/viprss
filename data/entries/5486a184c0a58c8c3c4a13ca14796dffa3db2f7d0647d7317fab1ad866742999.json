And now, if you’re just courting their perceptions, then you’re no longer independent! In fact you’re the opposite; you’re entirely dependent on how they perceive you. You’ve just traded one form of audience or partisan capture for another!</p></blockquote>\n\n        \n\n <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Chris%20Hayes\">Chris Hayes</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/journalism\">journalism</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/politics\">politics</a></p>\n\n\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"5486a184c0a58c8c3c4a13ca14796dffa3db2f7d0647d7317fab1ad866742999","category":"default"}
