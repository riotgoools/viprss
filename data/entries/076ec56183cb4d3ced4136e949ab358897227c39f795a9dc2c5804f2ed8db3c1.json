I wouldn't want to have to play against him tonight. </p>\n<p>Here's my two cents. If Brunson has heavy legs tonight, as he clearly did in the last two games, he should be used as a decoy, to draw a double team, to free up one of the Knicks' assassins. Or maybe he'll be more effective with just one Pacer guarding him, instead of two or three. </p>\n<p>And for crying out loud, start one of the excellent <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023%E2%80%9324_New_York_Knicks_season\">bench players</a>, McBride or Sims or Burks, or all of them, and make sure the heroes of games 1 and 2 get plenty of rest. </p>","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"076ec56183cb4d3ced4136e949ab358897227c39f795a9dc2c5804f2ed8db3c1","category":"default"}
