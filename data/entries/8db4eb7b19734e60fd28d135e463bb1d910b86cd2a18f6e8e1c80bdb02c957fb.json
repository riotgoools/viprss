{"title":"[RIDGELINE] Things Become Other Things — Available Now!","link":"https://craigmod.com/ridgeline/174/","date":1700611200000,"content":"Walkers, have I got a walking book for you:\nThings Become Other Things.\nIt’s a book about walking thousands of kilometers of the Kii Peninsula. About walking those old Kumano Kodō paths — but not the ones you probably know. It’s about talking with a thousand fishermen and farmers and kissa owners, about communing with the mountain fauna, about hopscotching around leeches. It’s about floods and tsunamis and the capricious fecundity of nature.","author":"","siteTitle":"Craig Mod","siteHash":"7358923c3192bccfb6b9f0032f475bef5140f12de0f235c80ca3d98e1a3d393b","entryHash":"8db4eb7b19734e60fd28d135e463bb1d910b86cd2a18f6e8e1c80bdb02c957fb","category":"Sites"}
