Books became e-books, vinyl records turned into MP3s, and film reels transformed into digital video files. It was mind-blowing at the time. Suddenly, we could carry entire libraries in our pockets!</p>\n<p>Many things were lost in translation. Remember the warmth of vinyl records? Or the smell of old books? Early digital tech couldn’t capture those sensory experiences. We gained convenience, sure, but at the cost of some of the richness that made those physical mediums special.</p>\n<p>I sit now in a massive room filled with legacy media that i can pick up and touch, regard, play and read that did not make this first leap and likely never will.</p>\n<p>The Internet Age: Speed Demons</p>\n<p>Then came the internet,  Information at our fingertips, instant communication across the globe – it was like science fiction come to life. But in our rush to make everything faster and more accessible, we started cutting corners.</p>\n<p>To squeeze data through limited bandwidth, we compressed files until videos looked like pixelated messes and music lost its depth. We chopped up long-form content into bite-sized chunks for quick consumption – micro chunking it as we called it at the turn of the century.  At each turn loss from information that did not make the cut for whatever reason and a lessening and reduction in cases that did make it.</p>\n<p>AI Takes the Wheel</p>\n<p>Now we’re entering a new era, Artificial Intelligence is starting to infer, interpret, analyze, synthesize and even create information on its own.</p>\n<p>Andrew Gray, a librarian at University College London, trawled through millions of papers searching for the overuse of words such as<br />\nmeticulous, intricate or commendable.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16887v1\">He determined that at least 60,000 papers involved the use of AI in</a><br />\n2023 — over one percent of the annual total. “For 2024 we are going to see very significantly increased numbers,” Gray told AFP.</p>\n<p>Another reduction of source material, further loss of context and over all diminishment.</p>\n<p>So, What Can We Do About It?</p>\n<p>How do we develop systems that preserve the richness of human experience and does not leave off the long tail and expressly look for it to be included? How do we find ways to keep the convenience of digital formats without sacrificing quality? How do we include the most robust set of information that carries forward.  What might we be leaving behind? Is there a way to bring it along for the ride?</p>\n<p></p>","author":"MDG","siteTitle":"Mark Ghuneim","siteHash":"fbdbfb355dab5247b3a3d9c04401313e99252873a1ae0fb1ea729c2e5736c6f3","entryHash":"7c5cb4ebb05a86799fb7efb58fd53f478e905b9375853f9a4c996c92980f3462","category":"default"}
