Ancient history now. As someone who’s lived through the dizzying pace of technological change, I’ve been fascinated by how we’ve transformed the way we store, share, and understand information.</p>\n<p>However this aspect really haunts me:  With each leap forward, we are leaving something important behind.</p>\n<p>I call these “transcoding eras,” At least three major ones, each has brought incredible advancements, but also introduced “yield loss” – a concept borrowed from manufacturing that I think applies perfectly to our data-driven world.</p>\n<h2>From Physical to Digital: The First Big Leap</h2>\n<p>The first era was all about turning physical stuff into digital format. Books became e-books, vinyl records turned into MP3s, and film reels transformed into digital video files. It was mind-blowing at the time. Suddenly, we could carry entire libraries in our pockets!</p>\n<p>Many things were lost in translation. Remember the warmth of vinyl records? Or the smell of old books? Early digital tech couldn’t capture those sensory experiences. We gained convenience, sure, but at the cost of some of the richness that made those physical mediums special.</p>\n<p>I sit now in a massive room filled with legacy media that i can pick up and touch, regard, play and read that did not make this first leap and likely never will.</p>\n<h2>The Internet Age: Speed Demons</h2>\n<p>Then came the internet,  Information at our fingertips, instant communication across the globe – it was like science fiction come to life. But in our rush to make everything faster and more accessible, we started cutting corners.</p>\n<p>To squeeze data through limited bandwidth, we compressed files until videos looked like pixelated messes and music lost its depth. We chopped up long-form content into bite-sized chunks for quick consumption – micro chunking it as we called it at the turn of the century.  At each turn loss from information that did not make the cut for whatever reason and a lessening and reduction in cases that did make it.</p>\n<h2>AI Takes the Wheel: The Current Frontier</h2>\n<p>Now we’re entering a new era, Artificial Intelligence is starting to infer, interpret, analyze, synthesize and even create information on its own.</p>\n<p>Another reduction of source material, further loss of context and over all diminishment.</p>\n<h2>So, What Can We Do About It?</h2>\n<p>How do we develop systems that preserve the richness of human experience and does not leave off the long tail and expressly look for it to be included? How do we find ways to keep the convenience of digital formats without sacrificing quality?</p>\n<p>Lets take take a moment before it is too late to consider: what might we be leaving behind? And is there a way to bring it along for the ride?</p>\n<p>In the end, it’s up to us to shape these transcoding eras. Let’s make sure we’re not just moving forward, but moving forward thoughtfully.</p>","author":"MDG","siteTitle":"Mark Ghuneim","siteHash":"fbdbfb355dab5247b3a3d9c04401313e99252873a1ae0fb1ea729c2e5736c6f3","entryHash":"7c5cb4ebb05a86799fb7efb58fd53f478e905b9375853f9a4c996c92980f3462","category":"default"}
