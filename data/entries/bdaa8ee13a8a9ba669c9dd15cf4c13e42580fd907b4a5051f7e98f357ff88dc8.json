How long does it take to switch to writing mode, get the idea down, and return to what you were doing. The less time it takes the more <i>fluidity. </i>Twitter totally won there. And we, the bloggers, made a tradeoff. We accepted fewer features and writing in a silo because it was practical. It worked, where less fluid software didn't. So they got all the causal writing, and over time sucked the life out of blogging. I think it's time to put the fluidity back, without compromising on features and lock-in.","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"bdaa8ee13a8a9ba669c9dd15cf4c13e42580fd907b4a5051f7e98f357ff88dc8","category":"default"}
