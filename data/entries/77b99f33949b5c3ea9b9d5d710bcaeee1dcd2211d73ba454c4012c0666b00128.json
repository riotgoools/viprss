My answer as a former teaching assistant who graded lots of student programs, absolutely. It rivals the intellect of every human being I know, including professors. It hasn't learned yet how to synthesize new ideas, it seems. And there are strong guardrails that keep it from going into certain areas. It is more capable than we know, therefore. BTW, I didn't realize he teaches at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulane_University\">Tulane</a>. I got my undergraduate degree there in 1976.","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"77b99f33949b5c3ea9b9d5d710bcaeee1dcd2211d73ba454c4012c0666b00128","category":"default"}
