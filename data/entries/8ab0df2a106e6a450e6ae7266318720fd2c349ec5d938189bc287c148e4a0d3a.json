{"title":"Why I don’t promote","link":"https://sive.rs/nopr","date":1458172800000,"content":"<p>\nEvery day, someone asks me to promote or announce something they’ve created.\n</p><p>\nEvery day, I have to say no, no matter who or what it is.\n</p><p>\nIt upsets me every time.\n</p><p>\nAlmost everyone I know is a creator.\nEveryone has made a song, site, video, book, business, or project.\nMost of them are quite good.\nI want them all to succeed.\n</p><p>\nI hate to play favorites.\nBut if I announced them all, my site and feed would be a daily firehose of “check it out”.\nOr if I was a discerning curator, it would be a full-time job.\n</p><p>\nI admire the curators.\nThey click every link, hear every idea, listen to every song, watch every video, read every article, assess every project, then share the best stuff they find.\nI’m so glad those people exist, but that’s the opposite of the life I want.\n</p><p>\nI’ve never been a fan.\nEven as a musician, I was never that into other people’s music.\nI just liked the creative process of making my own music.\n</p><p>\nEven now, I don’t check out much.\nIf I said OK to every “check it out”, I’d have to spend hours a day just surfing, browsing, listening, and watching.\nBut what I really love is making, making, making, and making.\n</p><p>\nSometimes a friend says, “Please. For me.”\nI have to say no to them, too.\nIt wouldn’t be fair to everyone else.\n</p><p>\nSo, <strong>a sincere apology</strong> to everyone who wants me to announce their thing.\nI try to be helpful in other ways.\nBut <strong>I’m just not a promoter.</strong>\n</p>\n<img src=\"/images/stepping.jpg\" />\n<div>Photo © <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/pss/1359407958/\">Paul Stevenson</a>.</div>","author":"Derek Sivers","siteTitle":"Derek Sivers","siteHash":"4098504c0d0759e13901f29e63f7d7dbb1d972a078c6dc4560660f373da5c25e","entryHash":"8ab0df2a106e6a450e6ae7266318720fd2c349ec5d938189bc287c148e4a0d3a","category":"default"}
