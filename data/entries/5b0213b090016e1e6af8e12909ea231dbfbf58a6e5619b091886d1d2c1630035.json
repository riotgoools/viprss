This is why I signed up for the platform in 2012. Five years later\nand I'm sick of the bullshit that seems to emanate from the projects I back.</p>\n<p>Of the 39 projects I have contributed money to, 10 are delayed (some are\ndelayed by about a year or more). <em>Good thing I'm not holding my breath.</em>\nLet's take a look at those projects, starting with the oldest.</p>\n<h2>Star Citizen</h2>\n<p>ğŸ“¸<a href=\"https://%F0%9F%94%A5.pixels.wtf/blog/image/2017/im-done-with-kickstarter-a.jpg\">Star Citizen on Kickstarter</a></p>\n<p>This game<a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cig/star-citizen\">1</a>, by Cloud Imperium Games Corporation, was successfully funded on\nNovember 19th, 2012. I backed at the $37 tier (Digital Scout) for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a digital copy of the finished game (PC)</li>\n<li>RSI Aurora spaceship ready to fly</li>\n<li>1,000 Galactic Credits</li>\n<li>exclusive access to the Alpha + Beta</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The estimated delivery date for this was November 2014. Of the unfulfilled\nprojects I backed, I am the <em>least</em> sore about Star Citizen because 1) I can\nplay the Alpha when I get a PC (I have a Mac) and 2) there are regular\nupdates. Not just, \"Oh hey guys, here's a wall of text and a pic or two\", it's\nactual gameplay and something I can interact with.</p>\n<p>I think the CEO got overly ambitious but at least it's not No Man's Sky-tier\nof fuckedupness.</p>\n<h2>Mighty No. 9</h2>\n<p>ğŸ“¸<a href=\"https://%F0%9F%94%A5.pixels.wtf/blog/image/2017/im-done-with-kickstarter-b.jpg\">Mighty No. 9 on Kickstarter</a></p>\n<p>This game<a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mightyno9/mighty-no-9\">2</a>, by comcept, is currently the laughing stock of the gaming world\nand a cautionary tale for game developers looking to create a Kickstarter for\ntheir game. It was successfully funded on October 1st, 2013. I backed at the\n$60 tier for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a physical game box (Western/Japanese style)</li>\n<li>printed retro-style game manual (English/Japanese)</li>\n<li>exclusive in-game golden hero (backer-exclusive color variation of Beck,\nthe game's hero)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The estimated delivery date for this was April 2015. I just got the physical\nrewards a week or two ago. The Nintendo 3DS version? Still waiting for it. I\nhave a Switch nowâ€¦</p>\n<h2>Sa: The Umbrella Reimagined</h2>\n<p>ğŸ“¸<a href=\"https://%F0%9F%94%A5.pixels.wtf/blog/image/2017/im-done-with-kickstarter-c.jpg\">The Sa umbrella on Kickstarter</a></p>\n<p>This umbrella<a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/860103721/satm-the-umbrella-reimagined\">3</a>, by Justin Nagelberg and Matthew Waldman, was successfully\nfunded on December 1st, 2014. I backed at the $69 tier for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>one Sa (early limited special)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The estimated delivery date was March 2015. Since being successfully funded,\nbackers have gotten uÌ¶pÌ¶dÌ¶aÌ¶tÌ¶eÌ¶sÌ¶ essays twice a year about why shipping has\nbeen delayed two years. Basically, because the umbrella is so different that\nfactories have to be taught how to work on components. Factories is plural\nbecause they've gone through a couple because of shutdowns. Who the hell knows\nwhen I'm gonna get this thing.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2017/09/14 update<ul>\n<li>another essay, but with TL;DR version!</li>\n<li>fully functioning prototype</li>\n<li>noticed weird things with prototype, fixes for those things is in progress</li>\n<li>shipping has been pushed back to Winter/Spring 2018</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To quote a backer, \"Great to see that after nearly 3 years you nearly have a\nworking prototype\".</p>\n<h2>The Light Phone</h2>\n<p>ğŸ“¸<a href=\"https://%F0%9F%94%A5.pixels.wtf/blog/image/2017/im-done-with-kickstarter-d.jpg\">The Light Phone on Kickstarter</a></p>\n<p>This phone<a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/thelightphone/the-light-phone\">4</a>, by Light, was successfully funded on June 27th, 2015. I backed\nat the $25 tier for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Light Book. It documents the process of building the Light Phone and\nincludes photos, drawings, and essays. It will cover the entire story from\nideation to insights into the manufacturing process.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The estimated delivery date was June 2016. I messaged the founders last month\nabout the book and this was the response:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Not yet. We would like to include our entire journey of the Light Phone and\nwe believe that there is more to come. We will email backers when we plan to\nrelease the book. Thank you for asking!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I'm not sure how much more of \"the journey\" needs to be documented but I hope\nI get it before the end of 2018.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2018/02/28 update<ul>\n<li>creators are launching a new campaign for Light Phone 2, but on\nIndiegogo<a href=\"https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/light-phone-2-smartphone-design\">5</a> this time</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here's what they had to say about backers that pledged for the book:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We have users that pledged for a process book in our original campaign, and\nwe want to acknowledge that we have not at all forgotten about you. We've\ncontinued to document the process and want the book to encompass the Light\nPhone journey in its entirety, through this second generation as well. We\nwill offer the book as a pledge in the next campaign as well (a $50\ndonation). We have a few ideas for ways to make this even more special for\nthose of you who originally donated with a limited edition bonus too.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The end of the Indiegogo campaign is scheduled to end April 2019. The\nKickstarter campaign ended June 2015. I was supposed to get the book\nJune 2016.</p>\n<h2>DÌ¶aÌ¶sÌ¶ Ì¶KÌ¶eÌ¶yÌ¶bÌ¶oÌ¶aÌ¶rÌ¶dÌ¶ Ì¶5Ì¶QÌ¶ GOT IT</h2>\n<p>ğŸ“¸<a href=\"https://%F0%9F%94%A5.pixels.wtf/blog/image/2017/im-done-with-kickstarter-e.jpg\">Das Keyboard 5Q on Kickstarter</a></p>\n<p>This keyboard<a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1229573443/das-keyboard-5q-the-cloud-connected-keyboard\">6</a>, by Das Keyboard, was successfully funded on July 30th, 2016.\nI backed at the $139 (early bird) tier for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>one Das Keyboard 5Q for $90 off the $229 retail price.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The estimated delivery date was January 2017. I have a regular Das Keyboard\n(Mac version) at home and I love it. What drew me to the 5Q was the ability to\nwrite scripts to mod the keyboard. You can create light shows, make certain\nkeys change color due to a specified event, and so on. Super customizable!\nAnyhoo, people are pissed off because the company makes keyboards for a living\nand we <em>still</em> don't have ours.</p>\n<p>Welp.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>2017/08/25 update</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Typhoon Hato damaged a factory in Hong Kong</li>\n<li>no injuries</li>\n<li>raw materials and critical production equipment were protected from damage</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><p>2017/08/31 update</p>\n<ul>\n<li>5Q pilot production will begin in a couple days</li>\n<li>full production schedule for the end of September</li>\n<li>Kickstarter fulfillment in October, barring any pilot production issues</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><p>2017/09/25 update</p>\n<ul>\n<li>solder quality for mechanical switches failed QA</li>\n<li>incorrect product packaging</li>\n<li>National Day in China for the first week of October</li>\n<li>production will start the week of October 30th</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><p>2018/02/28 update</p>\n<ul>\n<li>keyboards are shipping!</li>\n<li>Mac/Linux support is nonexistentâ€¦seriously</li>\n<li>105-key layout (international) keyboards have damaged switches</li>\n<li>according to a Superbacker and another backer who got theirs already, the\nkeyboard is straight <em>trash</em> from the hardware to the software</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><p>2018/03/13 update</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I opened a ticket with Das Keyboard's support channel to get the address\nfor the 5Q to be changed to one of my best friends.

I think it's\nsafe to say that the Das Keyboard team isn't going to make another crowdfunded\nproduct for a long time, if ever.

AIAIAI's TMA-2 is a modular\nheadphone system which means if something on my headphones breaks, I can just\nreplace a module or two and not the entire thing.

The latest update promises that\nI'll get this by the end of October at the latest. You might be wondering why\nI backed two Kickstarters that are headphone-focused. I like music and I'm\nbeginning to despise wires. Should the battery on my H05 run out, I can attach\na cable to it and that cable to the Jack.

Because retailers like B&amp;H received\nSteadicam Volts before backers, we all get a premium carrying case for free.\nNot bad, but I expected to get the Volt before this month so I could get\nawesome beach footage of my kids. It's now the middle of August so that plan\nwas ruined. When companies show prototypes that are <em>super</em> close to the\nfinished product and show they have years of experience doing things, and\nyadda x3, I expect to get rewards in a relatively short timeframe.

It used to be that you could pledge for something on\nKickstarter and expect to get the product on or damn close to the promised\ndelivery date. I love the idea of supporting promising businesses but I think\nI'll just wait until whatever product is available on Amazon before parting\nwith my money. Who wants to be constantly let down all the time?
