Here was her answer:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>Herge’s The Adventures of Tintin were foundational books for me — and probably why I’m in journalism today. </p>\n\n<p>Otherwise:</p>\n\n<p>Autobiography of Malcolm X<br />\nAudre Lorde’s “Sister Outsider”<br />\nHoward French: A Continent for the Taking</p>\n\n<p>And lately: Anaïs Nin’s diaries</p>\n\n<p>And I haven’t re-read them in a long time, but Barbara Ehrenreich’ Nickel and Dimed” and Dambisa Moyo’s “Dead Aid” were paradigm shifting for me.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>There are tons of good books mentioned <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/karenattiah.bsky.social/post/3ld2et5ighs24\">in the replies</a> and <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/karenattiah.bsky.social/post/3ld2et5ighs24/quotes\">quote posts</a>. One of the most faved answers <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/missrobin.bsky.social/post/3ld2ew3rmbk2n\">features</a> a book called <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/022652583X/ref=nosim/0sil8\">They Thought They Were Free: The Germans, 1933–45</a>, which I don’t think I’d ever heard of but sounds fascinating and unfortunately very relevant.</p>\n\n<p>In thinking about the books I’ve read that made a significant impact on how I see and understand the world, I’d have to go with:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Various Richard Scarry books (like <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0307157857/ref=nosim/0sil8\">Cars and Trucks and Things That Go</a>) when I was little, although Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood &amp; Sesame Street probably had a bigger and more lasting impact on who I am as a person.</li>\n\n<p><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0440412676/ref=nosim/0sil8\">Where the Red Fern Grows</a> was my favorite book as a child — I read it so many times. And there were these biography series for kids at my local library and I read a bunch of them. The two that I distinctly remember were the books on Thomas Edison and Harriet Tubman. From the Edison book I learned that a clever lad from the Midwest could make and invent wonderful things using your mind and your hands. And Harriet Tubman: she was straight-up a superhero and her story taught me all I needed to know about the truth of American slavery.</li></p>\n\n<p><li>I first read Orwell’s <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0452284236/ref=nosim/0sil8\">1984</a> in 1984, when I was 10 or 11. Probably affected my view of the world more than any other book.</li></p>\n\n<p><li>As an adult, I’d say that <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0679735666/ref=nosim/0sil8\">A Natural History of the Senses</a>, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1250808316/ref=nosim/0sil8\">Nickel and Dimed</a>, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/067974195X/ref=nosim/0sil8\">The Death and Life of Great American Cities</a>, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000JMKVE4/ref=nosim/0sil8\">1491</a>, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0143113453/ref=nosim/0sil8\">Chaos</a>, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0062397346/ref=nosim/0sil8\">A People’s History of the United States</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0679763880/ref=nosim/0sil8\">The Warmth of Other Suns</a> have formed the backbone of my view of the world. There are probably a few others that I’m forgetting, but those are the biggies.</li></p></ul><p></p>\n\n<p>How about you? What are your personal foundational texts?
