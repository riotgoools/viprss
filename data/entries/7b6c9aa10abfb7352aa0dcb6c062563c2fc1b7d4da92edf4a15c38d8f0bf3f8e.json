For the 16th year in a row, you can <a href=\"https://kottke.org/apollo-11/\">watch the original CBS News coverage of Walter Cronkite reporting on the Moon landing and the first Moon walk</a> on a small B&amp;W television, synced to the present-day time. Just open this page in your browser today, July 20th, and the coverage will start playing at the proper time. Here’s the schedule (all times EDT):</p>\n\n<p>4:10:30 pm: Moon landing broadcast starts<br />\n4:17:40 pm: Lunar module lands on the Moon</p>\n\n<p>4:20:15 pm - 10:51:26 pm: Break in coverage</p>\n\n<p>10:51:27 pm: Moon walk broadcast starts<br />\n10:56:15 pm: First step on Moon<br />\n11:51:30 pm: Nixon speaks to the Eagle crew<br />\n12:00:30 am: Broadcast end (on July 21)</p>\n\n<p>Set an alarm on your phone or calendar! Also, this works best on an actual computer but I think it functions ok on phones and tablets if necessary.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://kottke.org/18/07/live-tv-coverage-of-apollo-11\">Back in 2018</a>, I wrote a bit about what to look out for when you’re watching the landing:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>The radio voices you hear are mostly Mission Control in Houston (specifically Apollo astronaut Charlie Duke, who acted as the spacecraft communicator for this mission) and Buzz Aldrin, whose job during the landing was to keep an eye on the LM’s altitude and speed — you can hear him calling it out, “3 1/2 down, 220 feet, 13 forward.” Armstrong doesn’t say a whole lot…he’s busy flying and furiously searching for a suitable landing site. But it’s Armstrong that says after they land, “Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed.”. Note the change in call sign from “Eagle” to “Tranquility Base”. :)</p>\n\n<p>Two things to listen for on the broadcast: the 1201/1202 program alarms I mentioned above and two quick callouts by Charlie Duke about the remaining fuel towards the end: “60 seconds” and “30 seconds”. Armstrong is taking all this information in through his earpiece — the 1202s, the altitude and speed from Aldrin, and the remaining fuel — and using it to figure out where to land.</p></blockquote>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Apollo\">Apollo</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Apollo%2011\">Apollo 11</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Buzz%20Aldrin\">Buzz Aldrin</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Moon\">Moon</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Neil%20Armstrong\">Neil Armstrong</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/space\">space</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/TV\">TV</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Walter%20Cronkite\">Walter Cronkite</a></p>\n\n         <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/07/watch-1969s-apollo-11-moon-landing-live-1\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"7b6c9aa10abfb7352aa0dcb6c062563c2fc1b7d4da92edf4a15c38d8f0bf3f8e","category":"default"}
