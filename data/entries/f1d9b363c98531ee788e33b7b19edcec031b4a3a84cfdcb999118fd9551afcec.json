Arguably, every smartphone today fits the\nformer description. The latter? A whole bunch of <em>meh</em>. Sharp's Aquos\nCrystal<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Sharp-Aquos-Crystal-Sprint-Silver/dp/B00NWYANAI\">1</a> was the best contender before the X IMO, but I don't use Android.</p>\n<p>📸<a href=\"https://%F0%9F%94%A5.pixels.wtf/blog/image/2017/iphone-x-dream-phone-a.jpg\">Dat sweet design, dayum</a></p>\n<p>Enter iPhone X<a href=\"https://www.apple.com/iphone-x\">2</a>, a device leaked by a disgruntled employee inside Apple days\nbefore today's event. It <em>would have been nice</em> to have a proper surprise but\nhere in 2017, assholes are a dime a dozen. Anyhoo, this futuristic\ncommunication device succeeds in looking like such and that pleases me\n<em>immensely</em>. For context, I am currently rocking a 256GB Jet Black iPhone 7\nPlus. I purchased this phone and configuration primarily for the camera…<em>and\nshiny body</em>.</p>\n<p>My fiancé used to find my c̶o̶n̶s̶t̶a̶n̶t̶ ̶f̶i̶l̶m̶i̶n̶g̶ role as family historian irritating\nbut has come to accept it now, yahaha<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMgK_E6_GAE\">3</a>! She was pregnant with our son when I\nbought it and I correctly predicted that most of my content would be of him.\nMy daughter is becoming a p̶a̶i̶n̶ ̶i̶n̶ ̶m̶y̶ ̶a̶s̶s̶ tween and I don't want to miss out on\nher development/funny moments as well. Believe it or not, I've filled my phone\nat least twice over the past year and would've reached my phone's storage\nlimits a helluva lot quicker if I chose a lesser capacity.</p>\n<p>I explain all this to say I'm going to be one of those people plunking down\n$1149 for the piece of mind 256GB gives me. Fight me. (No really, some people\nseem pretty mad about the iPhone X on Twitter) 🤷🏾‍♂️</p>\n<p>I'm going to run down my favorite new features about the <em>definitive</em> iPhone.</p>\n<p><em>BUCKLE UP GANG</em></p>\n<h2>Cameras</h2>\n<p>Anyone who visits my Instagram page<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/spacemanfresh\">4</a> can see that I clearly <em>love</em> taking\nPortrait photos. While not perfect (Apple needs to find a way to deal with\ncurly hair), I can usually get some damn good shots on a consistent basis. The\noptical image stabilization allows me to run after my kids and get awesome\naction shots that aren't blurry as hell.</p>\n<p>For the X, Apple includes a <em>second</em> optical image stabilizer. This will make\nmy favorite kind of photo to take <em>even better</em>. In additional to a\nbetter-looking Portrait mode, we gain a new feature called\n\"Portrait Lighting\". Thanks to the extra sensors Apple seems keen on packing\ninto iPhone, Portrait Lighting allows me to light my subjects in five\ndifferent ways:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Natural Light</li>\n<li>Studio Light</li>\n<li>Contour Light</li>\n<li>Stage Light</li>\n<li>Stage Light Mono</li>\n</ol>\n<p>These modes emulate studio lighting and of course, since this is software it\ncan (and will) improve over time. The X will automatically optimize images as\nI take them. In theory that sounds great but, I don't know just yet if I'll\nlike how this optimization happens.</p>\n<p>When Apple initially introduced Portrait Mode, I've wanted it on the\nfront-facing camera and it's a reality now with the X (and iPhone 8 Plus, the\nPlus model always has a better/extra camera than the non-Plus model). FINALLY.\nGet ready for yours truly (and aspiring Instagram models) to use this feature\na LOT.</p>\n<p>Another feature I'm particularly excited for is the capability to shoot <em>4K\nvideo at 24fps</em>. This is cinema-quality videography, <em>in my friggin' pocket</em>.\nAre you <em>kidding</em> me?! This, coupled with the Steadicam<a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/tiffencompany/steadicam-volt-smartphone-stabilizer-shake-free-vi\">5</a> coming in the mail\nsoon, is going to make my videos <em>amazing</em>. I do believe I win for best family\nhistorian this year, the holidays are gonna be cinematically <em>gorgeous\ndaaaaahling</em>.</p>\n<h2>Face ID</h2>\n<p>📸<a href=\"https://%F0%9F%94%A5.pixels.wtf/blog/image/2017/iphone-x-dream-phone-b.jpg\">Internal shot of what makes Face ID possible</a></p>\n<p>̶W̶h̶e̶n̶ ̶C̶r̶a̶i̶g̶ ̶F̶e̶d̶e̶r̶i̶g̶h̶i̶ ̶b̶u̶n̶g̶l̶e̶d̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶i̶n̶i̶t̶i̶a̶l̶ ̶d̶e̶m̶o̶ ̶o̶f̶ ̶F̶a̶c̶e̶ ̶I̶D̶,̶ ̶I̶ ̶w̶a̶s̶ ̶c̶o̶n̶c̶e̶r̶n̶e̶d̶ ̶f̶o̶r̶\no̶b̶v̶i̶o̶u̶s̶ ̶r̶e̶a̶s̶o̶n̶s̶.̶ ̶T̶h̶e̶n̶ ̶h̶e̶ ̶t̶r̶i̶e̶d̶ ̶s̶e̶v̶e̶r̶a̶l̶ ̶m̶o̶r̶e̶ ̶t̶i̶m̶e̶s̶ ̶a̶n̶d̶ ̶i̶t̶ ̶w̶o̶r̶k̶e̶d̶ ̶c̶o̶n̶s̶i̶s̶t̶e̶n̶t̶l̶y̶\ne̶a̶c̶h̶ ̶o̶f̶ ̶t̶h̶o̶s̶e̶ ̶t̶i̶m̶e̶s̶,̶ ̶w̶h̶i̶c̶h̶ ̶l̶e̶a̶d̶s̶ ̶m̶e̶ ̶t̶o̶ ̶b̶e̶l̶i̶e̶v̶e̶ ̶h̶e̶ ̶m̶e̶s̶s̶e̶d̶ ̶u̶p̶ ̶s̶o̶m̶e̶h̶o̶w̶ ̶t̶h̶a̶t̶ ̶f̶i̶r̶s̶t̶\n̶t̶i̶m̶e̶ ̶(̶g̶o̶ ̶w̶a̶t̶c̶h̶ ̶f̶i̶r̶s̶t̶ ̶i̶m̶p̶r̶e̶s̶s̶i̶o̶n̶s̶ ̶v̶i̶d̶e̶o̶s̶ ̶f̶r̶o̶m̶ ̶p̶e̶o̶p̶l̶e̶ ̶w̶h̶o̶ ̶w̶e̶r̶e̶ ̶a̶c̶t̶u̶a̶l̶l̶y̶ ̶a̶t̶\nt̶o̶d̶a̶y̶'̶s̶ ̶e̶v̶e̶n̶t̶,̶ ̶F̶a̶c̶e̶ ̶I̶D̶ ̶g̶e̶t̶s̶ ̶d̶e̶m̶o̶e̶d̶ ̶i̶n̶ ̶s̶o̶m̶e̶)̶.̶</p>\n<p>Update from Apple to 9to5Mac<a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2017/09/13/face-id-demo-fail-details\">6</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"People were handling the device for stage demo ahead of time,\" says a rep,\n\"and didn't realize Face ID was trying to authenticate their face. After\nfailing a number of times, because they weren't Craig, the iPhone did what\nit was designed to do, which was to require his passcode.\" In other words,\n\"Face ID worked as it was designed to.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My main concern continues to be, <em>will this work for me?</em> I'm a black man with\na beard who wears glasses. <em>Snapchat doesn't think I exist</em> most times,\nwhereas my family can use Snapchat's face-tracking masks without issue. While\nApple's site shows a brown man with/without facial hair, glasses, and a hat, I\nhaven't seen any press media showcasing dark-skinned people using Face ID\nsuccessfully. Color concern may be unwarranted since an infrared camera,\ninfrared light, and dot mapping is used but facial hair? I look forward to\ntech reviewers testing this before launch. If MKBHD doesn't grow a beard, <em>I</em>\nwill be the one to test this for myself (and share the results with you all).</p>\n<p>Apple claims their Face ID neural networks/machine learning will track your\nface's changes over time. It will be interesting to see how it copes with\npeople undergoing reconstructive surgery and related facial matters.</p>\n<h2>Hardware Design</h2>\n<p>📸<a href=\"https://%F0%9F%94%A5.pixels.wtf/blog/image/2017/iphone-x-dream-phone-c.jpg\">iPhone 4, is that you?</a></p>\n<p>The iPhone 4 was a favorite to many and I remember the collective sadness\nonline when the iPhone 5 was released looking very different from the 4. I had\na Palm Pre at the time so I didn't care, haha. The X has a glass back like the\n4, but adds surgical grade stainless steel for the sides and bottom. The phone\nlooks seamless and I'm curious to know how it feels in the hand.</p>\n<p>I regularly give my son my phone while it's recording on the front-facing\ncamera because the results end up being pretty funny. Being a year and some\nmonths old, he <em>does</em> drop/throw/trip over/attempt to eat my phone so the\nextra sturdy design of the X will be much appreciated (my 7 Plus is holding up\nwell though!). I'm thinking about creating a YouTube channel in a few months\nto showcase #dadlife, and you may see some of these clips.</p>\n<p>According to Apple, normal ol' OLED wasn't good enough. They've made a \"Super\nRetina\" HDR display with a million to one contrast ratio, high resolution and\nbrightness, wide color support, and excellent color accuracy. In addition, the\nX gains \"True Tone\" technology like the latest iPad Pro. This automatically\nadjusts the color temperature of the screen to match the lighting environment\nyou're in, to reduce eyestrain.</p>\n<h2>Qi Charging</h2>\n<p>📸<a href=\"https://%F0%9F%94%A5.pixels.wtf/blog/image/2017/iphone-x-dream-phone-d.jpg\">Qi charging, never saw this coming</a></p>\n<p>The glass back of the X enables wireless charging and to be honest, I did not\nthink this would actually happen. Of course, the Apple-issued charging mat\nisn't coming until sometime in 2018 but the fact that it's coming at all is\ngreat. In the meantime, you can certainly purchase Qi charging pads from other\nmanufacturers. Apple says they've wanted w̶i̶r̶e̶l̶e̶s̶s̶ inductive charging since the\noriginal iPhone and a decade later they've done it! <em>Cue Android users saying\nthey've had it first.</em></p>\n<p>Qi is an industry standard for wirelessly charging devices. One of my best\nfriends swears by Qi and remarked that some fairweather Qi manufacturers are\ngonna come back into the fold (LG and HTC). I hope Qi and USB-C take the tech\nindustry by storm. One cable to rule them all and wireless charging for the\nrest!</p>\n<p>Clarification about Qi and AirPower, from John Gruber<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2017/09/iphone_x_event_thoughts_and_observations\">7</a> (emphasis mine):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The best way to think of it is that AirPower is to Qi what AirPods are to\nBluetooth.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>AirPower is going to be a superset of Qi with a layer of non-standard Apple\ntechnology on top of it to make it better</em>, just like how AirPods are a\nsuperset of Bluetooth with non-standard Apple technology on top. So iPhone 8\nand iPhone X can charge on any Qi charging pad, like the Belkin and Mophie\nones that Apple promoted on stage. Likewise, AirPods can be used as a\nregular Bluetooth headset connected to any Bluetooth device.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But AirPower can do things Qi cannot — it can charge Apple Watch and the\nupcoming new AirPod case. <em>Apple Watch and the AirPod case are not Qi\ndevices — you cannot charge them on a Qi charging pad.</em> That's similar to\nthe way AirPods (and the Beats headphones also equipped with Apple's W1\nchip) can do things regular Bluetooth headsets cannot — in particular, the\nseamless pairing process, and the lower audio playback latency enabled by\nthe W1.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The main difference between the non-standard aspects of AirPower compared to\nAirPods is that <em>Apple is pledging to offer their improvements to the Qi\nconsortium.</em> If the consortium accepts them, third-party companies will be\nable to make AirPower-like charging pads that do work with Apple Watch, the\nnew AirPod case, and more.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I was confused about Apple Watch and AirPod cases charging on Apple's pad\nbecause they didn't specify if only the <em>latest</em> versions of those devices had\nAir Power capability, or if past and present versions would work out of the\nbox. I'm still unsure but I'll update when I find out.</p>\n<h2>Animoji</h2>\n<p>🎥<a href=\"https://%F0%9F%94%A5.pixels.wtf/blog/video/2017/iphone-x-dream-phone-a.mp4\">iPhone emoji</a></p>\n<p>The TrueDepth camera on the X (in conjunction with the A11 Bionic chip)\nanalyzes 50 different muscle movements on your face and then applies them to\none of 12 pre-selected e̶m̶o̶j̶i̶ Animoji. You can record video messages with\nAnimoji (and your voice!) and share them inside of Messages. It should be\npossible to export these videos outside of Messages too. I hope there's a way\nto create your own Animoji (if you're a developer). I'd create a 3D version of\nmyself and use that Animoji exclusively.</p>\n<p>Apple just made it so anyone can be a (generic) Pixar character.</p>\n<h2>Criticism</h2>\n<p>On social media today, I've seen people complain (some, vehemently so) about\nthe price of the phone and say things like, \"This isn't worth it\", \"iPhone\neXtortion\", \"Just get a laptop\", and so on. I believe these people are\nreactionary and failing to see the bigger picture. They see the price and\nthink, \"That price…for a <em>phone</em>?\", and stop their train of thought…<em>derail\nit</em> even. In reality, <em>you aren't paying for just a phone</em>. You are paying for\na phone that rivals a DSLR camera and last I checked, those cameras are <em>not</em>\ncheap but, no one complains about them (probably because expectations of DSLRs\nhaven't changed over their lifetime, at least when compared to phones).</p>\n<p>For me, my personal communication device is only referred to as a phone\nbecause of legacy reasons (and it's shorter to say). It's kind of like how\nfloppy disks are still the universal symbol for save but we sync now. Hell,\n<em>even the phone icon</em> is legacy. Phones these days are flat slabs of metal,\nonly medical and government facilities have classic telephones.</p>\n<p>Another bit of criticism I've seen is regarding the ease of which law\nenforcement can forcefully obtain access to someone's iPhone X. The owner\ncould be handcuffed while a police officer holds the phone to their face and\nthen swipe to unlock the phone. As a black man in America, I find this to be\nthe <em>only</em> valid criticism I've seen thus far. Just a few days ago though, I\nfound a solution for that! It requires you to be observant and proactive but I\ntend to have my hand on my phone when I see police anyway…</p>\n<p>Juli Clover reported<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2017/08/17/ios-11-emergency-sos-disables-touch-id\">8</a> about the \"SOS Feature\" in iOS 11 for\nMacRumors (emphasis mine):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Emergency SOS is activated by pressing on the sleep/wake button of an iPhone\nfive times in rapid succession. When the requisite number of presses is\ncomplete, it brings up a screen that offers buttons to power off the iPhone,\nbring up your Medical ID (if filled out) and make an emergency 911 call.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Along with these options, there's also a cancel button. <em>If you hit the\nsleep/wake button five times and then hit cancel, it disables Touch ID and\nrequires a passcode before Touch ID can be re-enabled.</em> Touch ID is also\ndisabled if you actually make an emergency call.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This is a handy hidden feature because <em>it allows Touch ID to be disabled\ndiscretely</em> in situations where someone might be able to force a phone to be\nunlocked with a fingerprint, such as a robbery or an arrest. With Touch ID\ndisabled in this way, there is no way to physically unlock an iPhone with a\nfinger without the device's passcode.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It's also worth noting that <em>there's no real way to tell that Touch ID has\nbeen disabled in this manner</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>After reading this, I tested it immediately and it works like a charm. I\nadvise anyone with law enforcement concerns to practice this when you upgrade\nyour phone to iOS 11 or get the iPhone 8/8 Plus/X. It's probably a good idea\nto do this while going through customs as well.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>2017/09/16 update:\nTechCrunch interviewed Craig Federighi<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/15/interview-apples-craig-federighi-answers-some-burning-questions-about-face-id\">9</a> and here's how the above feature\nworks on iPhones 8 and X (emphasis mine):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>On older phones the sequence was to click 5 times [on the power button],\nbut on newer phones like iPhone 8 and iPhone X, <em>if you grip the side\nbuttons on either side and hold them a little while — we'll take you to\nthe power down [screen]. But that also has the effect of disabling Face\nID.</em> So, if you were in a case where the thief was asking to hand over\nyour phone — you can just reach into your pocket, squeeze it, and it will\ndisable Face ID. It will do the same thing on iPhone 8 to disable\nTouch ID.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It's worth noting that the squeeze can be of either volume button plus the\npower button. I'm going to test/practice this when I get mine.</p>\n<h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>\n<p>I'm excited.</p>\n<p>Like the original iPhone, I think iPhone X heralds a new era in smartphone\ndesign, development, and creative possibilities and I can't wait to get\nstarted. The AR games demoed at the event bored me, but ARkit demos on Twitter\nare <em>amazing</em>. I'm looking forward to seeing who creates the breakout AR app\neveryone's gotta have. I think there's opportunity for nearly every app to\noffer something interesting in the AR space, if only for demo purposes.</p>\n<p>I'm looking forward to upgrading to an Series 3 Apple Watch. The cellular\nversion is not for me as I'm hardly ever far away from my phone (and I don't\njog). I like the improved heart rate monitor and since my son's birth I've\nbecome more interested in my overall health. My Pebble Time is also showing\nits age by slowly breaking down so upgrade time is soon.</p>\n<p>All in all, it was a great event. Leakers don't deserve happiness. I'm going\nto download Final Cut. 🕸</p>\n<hr />\n<hr />\n<hr />\n","author":"","siteTitle":"the webb blog","siteHash":"d87386c8de21b16d23a4d22ceb0991728c5b4e4486d627490c6fcde14e563300","entryHash":"f1d9b363c98531ee788e33b7b19edcec031b4a3a84cfdcb999118fd9551afcec","category":"Sites"}
