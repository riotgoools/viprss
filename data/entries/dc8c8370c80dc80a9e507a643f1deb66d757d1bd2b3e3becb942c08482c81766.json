{"title":"A Huge Collaborative Flipbook Animation","link":"https://kottke.org/24/04/a-huge-collaborative-flipbook-animation","date":1714061709000,"content":"\n        <p>I love this: <a href=\"https://pudding.cool/projects/flipbook/\">The Pudding ran an online experiment</a> where they started with a shape (like a straight line or circle) and asked people to trace, as best they could, the tracing of the person before them. This resulted in a series of “flipbook” animation of how the shapes evolved over time — invariably, a squiggle.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>One thing I noticed right away was how all the squiggles ended up squished over on the right side of the screen. The Pudding team had a theory on why that happened (the 3:20 mark <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MC4H2hFkFNU\">in this video</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>I found this study from like 35 years ago - they were trying to figure out why people kept missing their targets on touch screens. They found people tended to touch below their target and people tended to touch closer to the edges of the screen. And so I figure if it’s like right-handers who are missing, you’re going to be missing to the right. We probably had about half the users on mobile and 90% of the those half are probably going to be right-handed so it would make sense that it would gradually go to the right.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://pudding.cool/projects/flipbook/\">Go read the rest of the post</a> — they also did an experiment about people’s inclination to draw penises on “any free-form drawing project on the internet”.
