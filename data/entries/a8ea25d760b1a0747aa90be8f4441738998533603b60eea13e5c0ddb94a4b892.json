I had two immediate ideas: build a world for my inner child, or a world for my dog <em>(this will definitely happen, in the next few months…)</em> I decided on my inner child. </p><p>then, in completing my own assignments from Day 1, 2, and 3 — what started out as an instructional mockup world… became something with soul, substance, and spirit to it. it was calling to me to create it, for real. </p><p>I’ve designed my course to be a narrative excavation — a slow unpeeling of the heart of the story — that is, I’m framing a website as a story; a book that’s constantly unfolding and being written, its pages shuffling and reshuffling. </p><p>my day 1 exercise and assignment is to map out the narrative elements of <em>who / what / when / where / how / why.</em> here’s my brainstorming map below. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure>\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/51e8148de4b01c1eb79c1977/37cdea8a-8e5e-4bfd-80e4-3a0b0816f845/day+1.jpg?format=1000w\" width=\"7168\" height=\"5408\" srcset=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/51e8148de4b01c1eb79c1977/37cdea8a-8e5e-4bfd-80e4-3a0b0816f845/day+1.jpg?format=100w 100w, https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/51e8148de4b01c1eb79c1977/37cdea8a-8e5e-4bfd-80e4-3a0b0816f845/day+1.jpg?format=300w 300w, https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/51e8148de4b01c1eb79c1977/37cdea8a-8e5e-4bfd-80e4-3a0b0816f845/day+1.jpg?format=500w 500w, https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/51e8148de4b01c1eb79c1977/37cdea8a-8e5e-4bfd-80e4-3a0b0816f845/day+1.jpg?format=750w 750w, https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/51e8148de4b01c1eb79c1977/37cdea8a-8e5e-4bfd-80e4-3a0b0816f845/day+1.jpg?format=1000w 1000w, https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/51e8148de4b01c1eb79c1977/37cdea8a-8e5e-4bfd-80e4-3a0b0816f845/day+1.jpg?format=1500w 1500w, https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/51e8148de4b01c1eb79c1977/37cdea8a-8e5e-4bfd-80e4-3a0b0816f845/day+1.jpg?format=2500w 2500w\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n <hr />\n\n\n  <h1>where the name came from</h1><p>I didn’t stumble upon the name <em>the mermaid castle</em> until Day 3 of the course. it comes from a few places — </p><ul><li><p>when I was a child, I was obsessed with fairytales. one of my most prized possessions when I immigrated from China was a white-bound book of fairytales — exquisitely illustrated in tiny square frames. there was no text (at least, not in my recollection). </p></li><li><p>when I moved to the US, I entered the world of Disney — the stories of princesses seemed more real to me than real life itself. maybe it was my way of escaping from a new reality / country / world that didn’t make sense to me — by losing myself into the mythical, magical fantasy worlds of evil stepmothers, potions, dragons, and princes. my parents bought me VHS tapes — one at a time — and I’d watch each classic Disney movie over and over and over again. </p></li><li><p>one of my favorite stories was <em>The Little Mermaid.</em> I had an alarm clock on my nightstand table of Disney Ariel on a glow-in-the-dark rock. it would wake me up in the morning with “Under the Sea” in beeping sounds. it was one of my favorite things I owned. </p><p></p></li></ul><h1>the mermaid castle is a safe place</h1><p>the mermaid castle is the home that my inner child dreamed of — to protect her from the confusions of life. things have meaning there. things make sense. especially the things that don’t make sense are retold in a way that make sense to a child. </p><p>it’s a semi-truthful, semi-fictional narrative world / construct that I’m creating to be an imaginative creative vessel for old and buried memories, like underwater polaroids, so that I can examine them more closely, and hold them up to the light. </p><p>at first, I thought that this name was very cheesy, but the more that I lingered with it, the more it felt right. my inner child thinks of herself as a mermaid, and she’s <em>always</em> alive and present, within me. </p><p>and, after many years of iteration, the current homepage of my website world for adult me — is oceanic themed. I laughed when I realized that. it seems as though I’ve never left the deep.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n<hr />\n\n\n  <p><strong>explore</strong> <a href=\"https://keningzhu.com/house-on-the-webs\">house on the webs</a></p><p><strong>see more:</strong> <br /><a href=\"https://keningzhu.com/journal/your-website-is-not-a-brochure\" target=\"_blank\">your website is not a brochure</a><br /><a href=\"https://keningzhu.com/journal/how-to-world-build-a-cyclical-guide\" target=\"_blank\">how to build a world: a cyclical guide</a><br /><a href=\"https://keningzhu.com/journal/the-obscurus-as-a-wounded-artist-child\" target=\"_blank\">the obscurus as a wounded artist child</a></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  <p><em>💌 I write a weekly newsletter on creative alchemy called </em><a href=\"https://buttondown.email/keningzhu?tag=guide.notes\" target=\"_blank\"><em>guide.notes</em></a><em>. find me also on my podcast: </em><a href=\"https://keningonline.squarespace.com/podcast\" target=\"_blank\"><em>botanical studies of internet magic</em></a><em>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n   ","author":"Kening Zhu","siteTitle":"kening zhu","siteHash":"ef8a94b9fc20c32a4ee7d94ee971337d278e8b2fafe747123e4eb5cea026e84e","entryHash":"a8ea25d760b1a0747aa90be8f4441738998533603b60eea13e5c0ddb94a4b892","category":"Sites"}
