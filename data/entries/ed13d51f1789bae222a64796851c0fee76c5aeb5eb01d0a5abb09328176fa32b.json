How do we get more? <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://sites.google.com/view/ian-calaway/home\">Ian Calaway</a> on the job market from Stanford has an interesting paper arguing that<a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://icalaway.github.io/job-market-paper/Calaway_JMP.pdf\"> early math mentors can be a force multiplier</a> for students with superior math abilities. Calaway estimates that having a math mentor at a school, someone who runs a math club and organizes entry into top math competitions, increases the number of students earning PhDs and pursing careers as scientists and professors. Not every school has such a math mentor but Calaway estimates (after taking into account underlying abilities, he’s not naive) that over 27 years, math mentors identified 9,092 American Math Competitions students (the cream of the crop) but there were 11,168 missing students of very high ability.</p>\r\n<blockquote><p>These 11,168 additional students represent the missing exceptional math talents who would have participated in the AMC and been identified as exceptional if they had access to a mentor…these mentors would have increased the number of these students attending selective universities (3,017 students), majoring in STEM (3,465 students), earning PhDs (1,652 students), and pursuing careers as scientists and professors (1,850 students) during this twenty-seven year period.</p></blockquote>\r\n<p>11,168 missing students of very high ability over 27 years may not sound like much but we are talking about the very top talent level. A footnote illustrates:</p>\r\n<blockquote><p>Sergey Brin (Google), Mark Zuckerberg (Meta), Peter Thiel (PayPal), and Sam Altman (OpenAI) were all top AMC scorers (Committee on the American Mathematics\r\n<br />\r\nCompetitions, 1980–2023)</p></blockquote>\r\n<p>High-IQ individuals don’t simply vanish without mentorship; they likely still have decent careers. However, even if you are skeptical about the social value of earning a PhD, the number of mentored individuals who go on to start firms or earn patents appears substantial. Just as athletic talent can wither without guidance, it seems that intellectual talent may also be underutilized without proper mentorship, with many high-IQ individuals failing to reach their full potential.</p>\r\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/11/increasing-the-supply-of-very-high-iq-workers.html\">Increasing the Supply of Very High-IQ Workers</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com\">Marginal REVOLUTION</a>.</p>\r\n<img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/907317434/0/marginalrevolution\" />\r\n<div><a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/907317434/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/907317434/marginalrevolution,\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/907317434/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/x.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/907317434/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/907317434/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/11/increasing-the-supply-of-very-high-iq-workers.html#comments\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/comments20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/11/increasing-the-supply-of-very-high-iq-workers.html/feed\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/commentsrss20.png\" /></a> \r\n<div><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/11/increasing-the-supply-of-very-high-iq-workers.html#comments\"><h3>Comments</h3></a><ul><li><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/11/increasing-the-supply-of-very-high-iq-workers.html#comment-160830054\">Alex: I have nothing against finding more math talent.
