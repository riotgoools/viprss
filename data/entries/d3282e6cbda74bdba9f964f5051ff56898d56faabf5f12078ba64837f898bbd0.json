Two-time Emmy nominee Stephen Robert Morse, who produced the Netflix documentary <em>Amanda Knox</em> and directed Netflix’s <em>How to Rob a Bank</em>, a true-crime documentary <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w20aHhlRjDc\">about a prolific bank robber</a>, is working on a doc about Mangione and the killing. </p><p>“This case is complex and raises important questions about vigilantism, the devastating cost of a privatized healthcare system and the inevitability of violence when peaceful change is seen as impossible,” Morse <a href=\"https://variety.com/2024/tv/global/luigi-mangione-documentary-stephen-robert-morse-amanda-knox-1236250741/?fbclid=PAZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAaaIu_wgnzakodTw-VSLrc8WYioNUekMBdUzvNx4rU9Tkqcxl96zqeKokCk_aem_dMOKXwBFofWtCA1gCTfSdQ\">said</a>. “My goal is to present a balanced exploration of United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson’s assassination, showing all sides of the story while respecting the profound loss of life and its impact on everyone involved.” The documentary will also provide historical context around America’s broken privatized health insurance system. </p><p>I talked to Morse by phone on Monday, and he told me that one thing that interested him was the universal reaction to the killing across the political spectrum. “I think so many people have been affected negatively by [our health care system],” he said.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.usermag.co/subscribe?\"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p>But to make a good doc, Morse needs stories and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/luigidoc_tips\">he wants to hear from everyone</a>: friends of Luigi, his family members, those who knew Luigi over the years, workers at UnitedHealth and other insurance providers, people who knew Thompson, and people who have been negatively affected by our for-profit insurance system. </p><p>“We're at a stage now where we want to find as many stories as possible,” Morse said. </p><p>To do that, his team has <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/luigidoc_tips\">set up an Instagram account</a> where users with any connection to the case can reach out with tips and information. Morse said that he wants to reach young people, especially Luigi’s peers, where they’re at and make it easy for them to connect. </p><div><div><a href=\"https://instagram.com/luigidoc_tips\" target=\"_blank\">luigidoc_tips</a></div><a href=\"https://instagram.com/p/DDh_iNaNT4h\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_640,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F__ss-rehost__IG-meta-DDh_iNaNT4h.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" /></a><div><div>A post shared by <a href=\"https://instagram.com/luigidoc_tips\" target=\"_blank\">@luigidoc_tips</a></div></div></div><p>In addition to Morse, Anonymous Content and director Alex Gibney’s Jigsaw Productions are developing a competing documentary project. Gibney is also in production on a film about Elon Musk and another documentary based on Salman Rushdie’s memoir <em>Knife: Meditations After an Attempted Murder</em>. It’s unclear what angle Gibney’s project will take. </p><p>Morse said that the two projects will likely differ based on what information and access each are able to garner. He also added that there’s room for more than one project covering this event. “There are different ways to tell the same story and they can all be good,” he said. </p><div><div><div><p>User Mag is a 100% reader-supported publication.

The bigger your platform, the more selective you can be about who to collab with. For years, Jimmy Donaldson aka MrBeast was the reigning king of YouTube and could be choosey.</p><p>But now, after a nearly five month cancellation following a string of controversies and allegations of workplace abuse and exploitation, Donaldson is throwing his usual selectivity out the window.</p><p>He’s <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DDp-FxlOiCS/\">half-assing videos</a> with obscure members of the Costocoverse like TikTok dancer Jersey Joe (<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DDp-FxlOiCS/\">look at the pain in Jimmy’s eyes</a>) and <a href=\"https://x.com/dexerto/status/1868764856293507256?s=46\">filming challenge-style collabs with creators</a> he'd likely never engage with otherwise. He has also teamed up with the <a href=\"https://x.com/fazeclan/status/1868763095897874895?s=46\">gaming content collective FaZe Clan</a>, and is <a href=\"https://www.dexerto.com/twitch/mrbeast-returning-to-twitch-with-massive-beast-games-co-stream-3007966/\">booting up his old Twitch channel</a> to start streaming again.
