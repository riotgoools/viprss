{"title":"New Film by Errol Morris: Separated","link":"https://kottke.org/24/10/new-film-by-errol-morris-separated","date":1728321730000,"content":"\n        <p></p>\n\n<p>Separated is the newest documentary film from Errol Morris. Based on Jacob Soboroff’s 2020 book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B07Z3SDYYW/ref=nosim/0sil8\">Separated: Inside an American Tragedy</a>, the film probes the inhumane family separation and immigration policies of the Trump administration. From <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/article/2024/aug/29/separated-review-quietly-furious-take-down-of-trumps-inhumane-border-policy\">a review in The Guardian</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>The Trump administration’s southern border policy began with the dream of a wall in the desert and ended with the nightmare of family separation: children torn from their parents and loaded en masse into wire-mesh cages. It was inhumane treatment, which was precisely the point. The White House’s intention was to use terror as a deterrent and effectively write every parent’s worst fear into law. “When you have that policy, people don’t come,” Donald Trump said blithely. “I know it sounds harsh, but we have to save our country.”</p>\n\n<p>Errol Morris’s forensic, procedural documentary walks us through the bureaucratic backrooms to show how the policy was hatched and implemented. It explains how its principal authors — Trump adviser Stephen Miller and attorney general Jeff Sessions — junked the pre-existing catch-and-release scheme (which had allowed migrants to remain in the country until their immigration hearing) in favour of a bold new tactic of forced separation and mass imprisonment. If Separated lacks the rueful exuberance that typifies much of Morris’s early work (The Thin Blue Line, The Fog of War, even last year’s John le Carré film), that is entirely understandable. The material is sobering and the mountain of evidence needs unpicking. The film-maker handles his brief with the cold, hard precision of an expert state prosecutor.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>From <a href=\"https://variety.com/2024/film/reviews/separated-review-errol-morris-family-separation-1236168070/\">a Variety review</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>“Harm to children was part of the point,” says Jonathan White, a committed public servant who saw his department, the Office of Refugee Resettlement, hijacked by a blatantly inhumane strategy that the Trump administration implemented for its deterrent potential. “They believed it would terrify families into not coming.” White isn’t exactly a whistleblower, although he comes across as no less courageous in describing a dictated-from-the-top family separation scheme for which he had a front-row seat.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>And here’s an interview with Morris &amp; Soboroff about the film:</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>For his second term, Trump and his team are <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/trumps-massive-deportation-plan-echoes-concentration-camp-history/\">planning</a> a blockbuster sequel to these inhumane crimes entirely in the open: deporting up to 20 million people (undocumented immigrants, documented immigrants, and political opponents) with a minimum of due process, which will require a massive increase in the scale of the police state and concentration camps. That’s 6% of the US population. We don’t know if they will succeed but they will try. Those are the stakes.</p>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/books\">books</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/crime\">crime</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/documentaries\">documentaries</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Donald%20Trump\">Donald Trump</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Errol%20Morris\">Errol Morris</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Jacob%20Soboroff\">Jacob Soboroff</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/movies\">movies</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Separated\">Separated</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/trailers\">trailers</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/video\">video</a></p>\n\n         <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/10/new-film-by-errol-morris-separated\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"e4123f9b223a9806d632729934f4367e91553564395a1256edcb088288cf12cb","category":"Sites"}
