The Dems shut down their online operation on Election Day, go off the air for 3.5 years, then reboot. The Repubs never sign off.  Trump is Archie Bunker. People vote for him, even if they don't agree, over the stranger they don't know. Voters kept saying this, but somehow this didn't register. Never nominate a candidate again who isn't well known to and tolerated by the electorate. Forget about <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2024/11/21/143547.html?title=noMoreGotchas\">gotchas</a>. The old Dems revolve around fear-of-gotcha. No longer a problem. A flaw proves you're genuine, authentic. Dems need a complete overhaul top to bottom. Their next leader should have a top podcast, because that's how you will govern from now on. Expect to be surprised how Trump does this starting Jan 20.","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"3c992365bd49dc068cbfaf5d1c3aae2554376a33b0eedbdec44f6adc77fe9cc5","category":"Sites"}
