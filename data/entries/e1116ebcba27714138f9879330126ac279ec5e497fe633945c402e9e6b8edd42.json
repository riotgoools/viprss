I thought no one else noticed this! Vermont drivers are unusually “nice” in this regard and it drives me bonkers.</p>\n\n<p>I was just explaining this to my son, a new driver, a couple of months ago. There’s a left turn at a one-way stop onto a busy road near my house that I do several times a week that is partially blind to oncoming traffic and you’ve really gotta commit when you do pull out because everyone’s doing 5-7+ mph over the limit coming around the curve. So, you end up sitting there for a bit and drivers coming from your right who are going to turn left in next to you will often see this and try to wave you through before they turn.</p>\n\n<p>But you can’t grant right of way like that! I can’t trust that they’ve checked if oncoming traffic is ok <em>and</em> that no one is trying to sneak around them on the right into the lane I’m supposed to be turning into (something that happens frequently at this intersection, and at speed). (There are also bikes and pedestrians to keep track of.) All this presumably nice gesture does is make the situation more dangerous for me because I now feel socially obligated to accept their favor and time pressure to be quick about it. But instead I decline and insistently wave them through, the other driver possibly now offended at having their good deed refused and thinking I’m the asshole.</p>\n\n<p>Just take the right of way when it’s yours and cede it when it’s not. That’s it — keep it predictable. That’s like 95% of driving right there.</p>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/traffic\">traffic</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/XKCD\">XKCD</a></p>\n\n         <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/07/driving-psa\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"e1116ebcba27714138f9879330126ac279ec5e497fe633945c402e9e6b8edd42","category":"default"}
