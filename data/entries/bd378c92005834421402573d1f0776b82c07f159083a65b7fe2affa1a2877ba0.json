White in 1973</a> to a man who said he had “lost faith in humanity”. It begins:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>As long as there is one upright man, as long as there is one compassionate woman, the contagion may spread and the scene is not desolate. Hope is the thing that is left to us, in a bad time. I shall get up Sunday morning and wind the clock, as a contribution to order and steadfastness.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>God, I hope he’s right.</p>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/E.B.%20White\">E.B.
