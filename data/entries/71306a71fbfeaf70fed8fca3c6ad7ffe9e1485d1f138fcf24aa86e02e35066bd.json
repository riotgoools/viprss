{"title":"[RIDGELINE] TBOT Press Check, Walking Matsumoto","link":"https://craigmod.com/ridgeline/172/","date":1697328000000,"content":"Hello Ridgeliners!\nThe mid-sized city of Matsumoto has always felt sunkissed to me. Bright. Never gloomy, though I’m sure it gets gloomy enough on certain days (maybe even on most days). For me, its rivers have always sparkled and burbled and the evening light has always cast the black castle into a strange golden grey. The trains into and out of the city are impressive — skirting cliffs, riding high above expanding valleys and through the hulking alps ranges and generally providing the drivers with, one imagines, a surfeit of excitements riding up in that flat nose of the lead car, hanging over the tracks, watching the world flit past.","author":"","siteTitle":"Craig Mod","siteHash":"7358923c3192bccfb6b9f0032f475bef5140f12de0f235c80ca3d98e1a3d393b","entryHash":"71306a71fbfeaf70fed8fca3c6ad7ffe9e1485d1f138fcf24aa86e02e35066bd","category":"Sites"}
