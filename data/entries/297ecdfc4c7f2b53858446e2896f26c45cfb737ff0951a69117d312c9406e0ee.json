To survive and thrive while rooted in a single spot, plants have adapted ingenious methods of survival. In recent years, scientists have learned about their ability to communicate, recognize their kin and behave socially, hear sounds, morph their bodies to blend into their surroundings, store useful memories that inform their life cycle, and trick animals into behaving to their benefit, to name just a few remarkable talents.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>I heard about it <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/05/06/1249310672/plant-intelligence-the-light-eaters-zoe-schlanger\">from NPR’s Fresh Air</a> — check out this completely metal behavior:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>Schlanger notes that some tomato plants, when being eaten by caterpillars, fill their leaves with a chemical that makes them so unappetizing that the caterpillars start eating each other instead. Corn plants have been known to sample the saliva of predator caterpillars — and then use that information to emit a chemical to attract a parasitic wasp that will attack the caterpillar.</p>\n\n<p>Schlanger acknowledges that our understanding of plants is still developing — as are the definitions of “intelligence” and “consciousness.” “Science is there [for] observation and to experiment, but it can’t answer questions about this ineffable, squishy concept of intelligence and consciousness,” she says.</p></blockquote>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/books\">books</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/plants\">plants</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/The%20Light%20Eaters\">The Light Eaters</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Zoe%20Schlanger\">Zoe Schlanger</a></p>\n\n         <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/05/the-light-eaters-and-plant-intelligence\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"297ecdfc4c7f2b53858446e2896f26c45cfb737ff0951a69117d312c9406e0ee","category":"default"}
