On the other hand, the documentary is called When Whales Could Walk, so that’s on me. I should have seen that coming. I did that to myself. And now I’m doing it to you.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>This fossil graveyard, millions of years old, is known as the “Valley of the Whales.” Now, paleontologists have unearthed a whole new species of ancient whale dating to 43 million years ago, and this predator wasn’t just able to swim – it also had four legs and could walk. </p></blockquote>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>(via <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/propcazhpm.bsky.social/post/3kkhhjkt3bc2x\">@propcazhpm.bsky.social</a>)</p>\n\n <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/pbs\">pbs</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/whales\">whales</a></p>\n\n <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/03/when-whales-could-walk-excuse-me\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Aaron Cohen","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"84ac7bdfbd903dbc497e4323b48dd62b8e3ca6b2d8cdc4ad7c9a47ca5f3f10cb","category":"default"}
