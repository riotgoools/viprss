{"title":"Quiet mode for the blogroll","link":"http://scripting.com/2024/04/20/161811.html?title=quietModeForTheBlogroll","date":1713629891000,"content":"<p><img src=\"https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/04/20/blogroll2.png\" />After living with the blogroll on the home page of Scripting News for <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2024/03/13/010313.html\">about a month</a>, and having heard from early testers, I felt that it was demanding too much attention when I was reading stuff on the blog. So I made some time last week to experiment with something I called Quiet Mode.</p>\n<p>In <i>Quiet Mode,</i> the blogroll doesn't call attention to itself until you click on it. Then its background changes from neutral to white. That's the equivalent of shining a spotlight on it. Also the borders become blue to indicate that the browser's focus is on the blogroll.</p>\n<p>I wanted to do more to tone it down. So, in Quiet Mode the title moves up and to the left, and is in a much smaller font, boldface, nicely visible and stands off from the list, but doesn't call your attention to it. It's there when you want to know what this thing is. </p>\n<p>You may want to call it something other than a blogroll, btw. If you're using blogs to coordinate projects in a workgroup, something I think a lot more people would do if if it worked better, instead of \"blogroll\" you'd might call it your \"workgroup.\"</p>\n<p>Anyway, I have switched Scripting News over to the quiet mode, and it's already the default, but I put a checkbox just above the blogroll that lets you toggle between the two modes to see the difference and possibly spot problems. I've started a thread on GitHub to discuss. </p>\n<p>Here's a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/zfNS97NUHB4\">quick video demo</a> of Quiet Mode. </p>\n<p>And a <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/304\">place</a> to comment or ask questions.</p>\n<p>BTW, the checkbox will go away before long. I just want it there to quickly do an A-B comparison.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"7ef6eeded9f3f4a2048bd2d2e42929d890a6e2a9ff0fbeeed4c6a5313b2163dc","category":"default"}
