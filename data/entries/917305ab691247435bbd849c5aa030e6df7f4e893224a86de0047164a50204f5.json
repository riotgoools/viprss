He is an educator after all. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I read his newsletter, <a href=\"https://www.oneusefulthing.org/\">One Useful Thing</a>, regularly and he recently launched published a companion site called <a href=\"https://www.moreusefulthings.com/\">More Useful Things</a>, no doubt due to his his forthcoming book, <a href=\"https://www.moreusefulthings.com/book\">Co-Intelligence: Living and Working with AI</a>. I pre-ordered, which grants me access to special GPTs. Such a cool promotional idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://bradbarrish.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/15717-co-intelligence-by-ethan-mollick.jpeg\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I realize this all may read like a shill. It’s not. I’ve learned so much from Ethan’s highly approachable and applicable writing and videos. If you want to learn more about leveraging the technology and its implications on education and work, Ethan has proven himself a great teacher.  </p>","author":"bradbarrish","siteTitle":"Brad Barrish","siteHash":"91e49f51884b2947fac16e947ba7e59fe5a24800befb4760d388da1b057f4f23","entryHash":"917305ab691247435bbd849c5aa030e6df7f4e893224a86de0047164a50204f5","category":"Sites"}
