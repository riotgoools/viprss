{"title":"My Brilliant Friend Season Four Is Here!","link":"https://kottke.org/24/09/my-brilliant-friend-season-four-is-here","date":1725993942000,"content":"\n        <p></p>\n\n<p>Well, I don’t know how I missed this, but the fantastic HBO series <a href=\"https://www.max.com/shows/my-brilliant-friend/f06b8347-6738-4e58-bdbd-1de2ca8c9938\">My Brilliant Friend</a> is back for its fourth and final season. The series is based on <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1609455053/ref=nosim/0sil8\">Elena Ferrante’s Neapolitan novels</a> and this season covers the events of the fourth book, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1609452860/ref=nosim/0sil8\">The Story of the Lost Child</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I love My Brilliant Friend — it’s one of my all-time favorites and might be the best show you’re not watching. I agree completely with Clare Thorp’s description of it as <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20240909-why-my-brilliant-friend-is-one-of-the-best-shows-on-tv\">“criminally underrated”</a>.</p>\n\n<p>As the trailer above shows, the previous two lead actors (who were <em>excellent</em>) have been replaced by older ones, a change I’m a little apprehensive about, but everything else about the show has been pitch perfect so I’m gonna trust the process. From <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/09/09/nx-s1-5071111/my-brilliant-friend-lenu-lila-hbo-drama-final-season\">an NPR piece</a> on the new season:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>“This child is you, when you were a child,” Maiorino recalled her friend Alessia saying about the novel’s titular protagonist and sometimes antagonist Lila. Like Lila and her friend Lenù, Maiorino is from Naples and stayed in the south, while her friend left to study in the north of the country, get married and have children.</p>\n\n<p>Art has now truly imitated life for Maiorino, who plays Lila in the fourth season of the series.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>New episodes of My Brilliant Friend started airing on HBO last night and will drop every Monday for the next 10 weeks. <a href=\"https://www.max.com/shows/my-brilliant-friend/f06b8347-6738-4e58-bdbd-1de2ca8c9938\">Go check it out!</a></p>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/books\">books</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Elena%20Ferrante\">Elena Ferrante</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/HBO\">HBO</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/My%20Brilliant%20Friend\">My Brilliant Friend</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/trailers\">trailers</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/TV\">TV</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/video\">video</a></p>\n\n         <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/09/my-brilliant-friend-season-four-is-here\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"9cf91bca147d1f5a0bf0a6ad42e40b6ad810b6b232bb774936154a8deded36b4","category":"Sites"}
