You got a flurry of tweets from every major C.E.O. in America — every major tech C.E.O., every bank C.E.O. — fawning over Trump, congratulating him and telling him how much they wanted to work well with him. I think that this is a very sad development that’s happened. It’s not entirely because of Trump. But we have politicized the economy in America. All this industrial policy, these tariffs, these bans. What that does is it suddenly makes Washington a very crucial arbiter to the success of business. You add to it Trump, who personally loves the idea of fining Caterpillar for doing this and Harley Davidson for doing that and Chase for doing — he views it as his job as president to literally dole out rewards and punishments to companies, depending on whether they do what he regards as the right thing or the wrong thing. It’s deeply saddening to me as somebody who grew up in India, where this is business as usual. Every business had to slavishly pander to whoever the prime minister at the time was. And you see it in Musk. Tesla stock, in the two days after Trump won, was <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA/\" target=\"_blank\">up 20 percent</a> or something like that, adding <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musks-net-worth-soars-past-300b-trump-election-win-2024-11\" target=\"_blank\">tens of billions of dollars</a> to Elon Musk’s net worth. Nothing fundamental in the economics had changed for Tesla. There was just an expectation, now that he was a friend of Trump’s, that he was going to somehow be showered with federal largesse. You know, there’s a guy in India called Adani who’s <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://theaidem.com/a-friend-indeed-adani-and-modi-a-timeline/\" target=\"_blank\">Modi’s best friend</a>, and his stocks trade at <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Market-Spotlight/Adani-retains-astronomical-valuation-even-after-stock-market-rout\" target=\"_blank\">multiples 10 times that</a> of every other Indian company. Because everyone assumes that at the end of the day, being Modi’s best friend is worth $100 billion or something like that.</p>\r\n<p>DUBNER: That’s probably a pretty safe assumption.</p>\r\n<p>ZAKARIA: It’s a safe assumption in India. What’s tragic is it might even be a safe assumption in America. But it’s not what the American economy was supposed to be about. And I think it’s a very sad trend.</p></blockquote>\r\n<p>Hat tip: Larry White.</p>\r\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/12/zakaria-on-rent-seeking.html\">Zakaria on Rent Seeking</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com\">Marginal REVOLUTION</a>.</p>\r\n<img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/909324947/0/marginalrevolution\" />\r\n<div><a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/909324947/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/909324947/marginalrevolution,\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/909324947/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/x.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/909324947/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/909324947/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/12/zakaria-on-rent-seeking.html#comments\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/comments20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/12/zakaria-on-rent-seeking.html/feed\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/commentsrss20.png\" /></a> \r\n<div><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/12/zakaria-on-rent-seeking.html#comments\"><h3>Comments</h3></a><ul><li><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/12/zakaria-on-rent-seeking.html#comment-160846028\">In reply to john.
