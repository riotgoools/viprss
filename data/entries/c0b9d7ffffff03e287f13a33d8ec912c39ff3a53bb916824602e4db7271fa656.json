Yesterday's one sentence <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2024/05/11.html#a225751\">comment</a> was based on decades of reading the NYT, and the story told by their executive editor in a recent <a href=\"https://www.semafor.com/article/05/05/2024/joe-kahn-the-newsroom-is-not-a-safe-space\">interview</a>, who has imho completely lost his way. Using polls, which have proven not reliable, and are subject to manipulation by the NYT and other opinion leaders, to determine what they cover, that's marketing, not journalism. Journalism would tell us what to expect if we elect one candidate over another, if the differences are obvious, as they are in 2024. The NYT is not doing that, by its own admission, and based on observation. I ask my readers, some of whom are influential people themselves, do we accept this, and keep trying to get the NYT to understand and deliver on their responsibility, or take the problem on ourselves. I believe we have the tools and resources to do so, all we need is determination.","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"c0b9d7ffffff03e287f13a33d8ec912c39ff3a53bb916824602e4db7271fa656","category":"default"}
