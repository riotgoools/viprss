How can I tell if you're intelligent. How do I know I'm intelligent. It could be my \"intelligence\" is as algorithmic as ChatGPT's. It could be that my intelligence is only a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-preservation\">survival mechanism</a>, and the only way I could think of something I think is intelligent is if it furthers my chance to reproduce. But what happens when our intellect instructs us to destroy the environment we depend on for life? It could be we are already obsolete, without the robots, it sure feels that way, and that our only <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah%27s_Ark\">ark</a> that could lead us to a new place where our species can survive in some form is for us to morph into electronic beings whose intelligence is distributed around the planet so we don't die if it becomes uninhabitable in one place, but not in others. And a LLM might thrive in an environment that can't support human life.","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"42c1dbf082af45149427687061985ca32c799433d649fdf82ab96d67d71f456b","category":"default"}
