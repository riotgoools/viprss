Those container leech PFAS “forever chemicals” at “alarming levels” into anything put into the containers.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The fifth circuit judges wrote that the EPA would have to regulate the containers under section 6 of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), which the judges and Inhance claim would require the EPA to take into account the economic impact on Inhance. The company has said a ban on its fluorination process would put it out of business.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Seems like they should be put out of business to me.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"micro.brad","siteHash":"27daae1c149c6ec5a964b1fe9266f5a58f96cfb4b36e39006f255c6b2b53a76d","entryHash":"4b4a01f7b51b570a6cad2345283849379749280dcf75192f4386dc5cbe3b7a67","category":"default"}
