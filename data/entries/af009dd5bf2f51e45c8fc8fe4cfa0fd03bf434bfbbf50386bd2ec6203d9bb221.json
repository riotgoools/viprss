{"title":"The NYT runs on freedom and apparently they don't know that","link":"http://scripting.com/2024/05/10/152411.html?title=theNytRunsOnFreedomAndApparentlyTheyDontKnowThat","date":1715354651000,"content":"<p>This is a hard idea to get across, but there's nothing wrong with a news organization favoring things they depend on to exist.</p>\n<p>For example, a news org that covers San Jose, CA is entitled to favor San Jose. It's okay for them to do things that help San Jose in competition with other cities. They could sponsor a food drive for the neediest in their community. It wouldn't be a conflict of interest, because it's understood that they have an interest in the success of San Jose. </p>\n<p>A columnist that covers the NY Mets can be happy when the Mets win the World Series, and sad when they don't. This is not an integrity issue, or something they need to disclose, unless it's not obvious that they cover the Mets.</p>\n<p>In that sense, every news org in the United States depends on the First Amendment, so it can be assumed they're in favor of democracy, because without it they couldn't exist. </p>\n<p>This is why the editor of the NYT's statement about not favoring democracy is so ridiculous. He can't be objective about that, because the existence of his organization depends on the continuation of democracy in the US.</p>\n<p>Whether he knows it or not, he's against Trump and in favor of the Democrats in the upcoming election.</p>\n<p>Sometimes it's hard to see what's totally obvious. Ask a fish about water and they'll say there is no such thing. Same with free speech and the NYT. They are a product of free speech, without it, it makes no sense, doesn't work. But that's been true forever, so it feels like a given, but it isn't.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"af009dd5bf2f51e45c8fc8fe4cfa0fd03bf434bfbbf50386bd2ec6203d9bb221","category":"default"}
