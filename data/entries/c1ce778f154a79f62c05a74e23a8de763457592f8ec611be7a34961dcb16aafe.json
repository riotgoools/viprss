I don’t know, but I expect it will end up as the very last one.” Tyler Cowen shared an eclectic <a href=\"https://www.tetragrammaton.com/content/tyler-cowen-choral-music\">choral music playlist</a> the other day, with the preceding lines as an intro, and the idea of a “last instrument” was pleasingly creepy to me. It also reminded me of the above video, of artist Maria Coman singing the “Love is patient, love is kind” lines from the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Epistle_to_the_Corinthians\">First Epistle to the Corinthians</a>, from the Bible. (<a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2013%3A1-8&amp;version=NIV\">1 Corinthians 13: 1-8</a>.) More of Coman’s music can be found on her <a href=\"https://www.mariacoman.com/english\">website</a>. And what is that church she’s in? </p>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Maria%20Coman\">Maria Coman</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/music\">music</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Tyler%20Cowen\">Tyler Cowen</a></p>\n\n         <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/05/romanian-singer-maria-coman\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Edith Zimmerman","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"c1ce778f154a79f62c05a74e23a8de763457592f8ec611be7a34961dcb16aafe","category":"default"}
