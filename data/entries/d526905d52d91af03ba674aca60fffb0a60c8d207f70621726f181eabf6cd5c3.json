But in the past 72 hours Peanut has become martyr for the entire right wing internet, who is using Peanut's death to rally support for Trump days before the election. </p><p>JD Vance called Peanut the “Elon Musk of squirrels” and said that Trump was “fired up” over the animal’s death. </p><p>On Saturday, the official Twitter account of the GOP House Judiciary Committee <a href=\"https://x.com/JudiciaryGOP/status/1852847983009677529\">posted about Peanut</a>.

The Wall Street Journal <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/opinion/new-york-arrests-pnut-the-squirrel-raccoon-cops-raid-f6acd97a\">ran an opinion piece</a> decrying Peanut's death as an example of \"abusive government\" and tried to tie the incident to crime on New York City subways and Democrat-run government.

At a rally on Sunday, JD Vance called Peanut the “Elon Musk of squirrels” and said that Trump was “fired up” over the animal’s death. </p><div></div><p>Longo is an animal lover who rescued Peanut and a raccoon named Fred over a year ago. He said that he had tried to return Peanut to the wild, but the little animal couldn't survive on his own. Longo didn't have the heart to abandon the squirrel, so he cared for Peanut and began posting his adventures with the animal online. </p><p>Peanut became a social media sensation and amassed hundreds of thousands of followers across <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@peanut_the_squirrel12\">TikTok</a>, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/peanut_the_squirrel12/\">Instagram</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Peanutthesquirrel12\">Facebook</a>. The squirrel received A-list treatment and even slept in his own bedroom. But after receiving a complaint about his animals (possibly <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2024/11/03/us-news/who-ratted-out-pnut-the-squirrel-owners-have-their-theory-and-its-a-rich-one/\">made by someone jealous of Longo's skyrocketing OnlyFans revenue</a>), authorities from the New York state departments of Environmental Conservation and Health raided Longo's house last Wednesday. </p><p>Longo was served a warrant and the officials removed Peanut and Fred from his possession. They claimed that Peanut bit a police officer, and so they had to euthanize him to test for rabies, but Longo doesn't buy it. He told several media outlets that Peanut has never harmed anyone and that it would be extremely rare for anyone to get rabies from a squirrel.</p><p>“They treated me like I was a terrorist,\" Longo told <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2024/11/02/us-news/caretaker-of-peanut-the-squirrelreeling-over-five-hour-raid-of-his-house/\">one outlet</a>. \"They treated this raid as if I was a drug dealer.

As one user <a href=\"https://x.com/PowerCleener/status/1853258653652119763\">put it</a>, \"The online right is desperate for a narrative to materialize, and they’re trying to brute force it with the timer running out.\" </p><p>Polls just 48 hours out are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/04/us-presidential-election-trump-harris-updates\">showing Harris pulling a slight lead</a> and the right wing internet seems to be spiraling. With nothing substantial to grasp onto, they have coalesced around the story of Peanut out of convenience, attempting to ascribe a political agenda to the animal's death. </p><p>To me, this is indicative of a campaign and culture that is Too Online. Trump’s base has always consisted of droves of hyper online weirdos and radicalized internet communities, but lately their attempts at ginning up controversy and attention have been falling flat. </p><p>For instance, over Halloween weekend, a slew of right wing figures <a href=\"https://www.disruptionist.com/p/donald-trumps-campaign-shares-a-good\">posted themselves wearing garbage bags</a> in a misguided attempt to clap back at Biden seemingly calling Trump supporters “garbage.” Unfortunately, most people who saw their costumes assumed they were doubling down on comedian Tony Hinchcliffe’s comment calling Puerto Rico a “floating island of garbage\" at Trump's MSG rally last week.
