All I want to do is cross-post, along with Masto and Bluesky. I did both those a loooong time ago. But I really want my links to go to threads, and also create a thread-writer for it like the one I did for Twitter and Bluesky. There's no shortage of really interesting projects now, so I think I'm going to have to wait to do this for a while. If anyone makes a really simple Hello World for Threads for Node.js that would make my day. <span>ðŸ˜„</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"c4103842b7d074dc2e840fe9dad5fdf2581cea42579f8289ee51aaecf0a4e5cd","category":"default"}
