Justice reminds Beane how much he's paying him, and Beane says I'm going to tell it to you straight -- half your salary is being paid by the Yankees. Think about it. They're paying all that money for you to play <i>against</i> them. That's how I feel about Fox. How much will it cost to get them to STFU. Whatever it is it's worth it.","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"f147ea71f7a3eb625764d4740e48f74e71cf68d50051387469895c8bc942f270","category":"default"}
