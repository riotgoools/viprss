Riding all the rooftops, riding all the railings, you know, itâ€™s a really interesting space. Not just anyone can go there! As soon as you see that kind of big overhanging piece of architecture or whatever, you immediately imagine the different things you could do up there. So, it was cool to finally get to come here to actually do it.</p></blockquote>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Adidas\">Adidas</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/architecture\">architecture</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/biking\">biking</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Danny%20MacAskill\">Danny MacAskill</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/video\">video</a></p>\n\n         <p>ðŸ’¬ <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/11/danny-macaskill-rides-the-adidas-hq\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> â†’</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"22b95486959db2d9c09c659b27511b0d36e58077071f0f25427947c8e067e5c6","category":"Sites"}
