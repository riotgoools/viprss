From <a href=\"https://about.usps.com/newsroom/national-releases/2023/1023-usps-reveals-stamps-for-2024.htm\">the USPS press release</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>Captured by the James Webb Space Telescope, this extremely high-definition infrared image shows the magnificent Pillars of Creation formation within the Eagle Nebula. By assigning color to various wavelengths, the digitized image allows us to see a landscape otherwise invisible to the human eye. Red areas toward the end of the pillars show burgeoning stars ejecting raw materials as they form, while the relatively small red orbs scattered throughout the image show newly born stars.</p>\n\n<p>This remarkable image from the James Webb Space Telescope is a digitally colored depiction of the invisible bands of mid-infrared light emitted by the Cosmic Cliffs of the Carina Nebula. Red and yellow flares scattered throughout the cliffs show developing and newly born stars. The orange-and-brown clouds in the lower third of the image are swirls of dust and gas. Additional stars, in our Milky Way and in distant galaxies, appear in the blue and black regions above and beyond the nebula.</p></blockquote>\n\n        \n\n <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/astronomy\">astronomy</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/James%20Webb%20Space%20Telescope\">James Webb Space Telescope</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/science\">science</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/space\">space</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/stamps\">stamps</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/USPS\">USPS</a></p>\n\n <p>ðŸ’¬ <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/02/spectacular-jwst-photos-adorn-new-usps-stamps\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> â†’</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"918c4650d684f5c2601fb94046cb6db567813386020f3f93fe346b1ff5034f8f","category":"default"}
