Code uses the Kin token that came out of the Kik mobile messaging app. The Code team are the same folks that built Kik and Kin. I’ve been working with them for almost a decade and a half and it has been a wild and fun ride.</p>\n<p>You need the Code app to do anything with Code but once you have it, it is slick. You can download Code here or by scanning this QR code:</p>\n<p>One of my favorite features of Code is the tip card. Here is mine:</p>\n<p>If you have Code on your phone, you can also go to https://tipcard.getcode.com/X/fredwilson</p>\n<p>Anyone who has the Code app can scan that card and tip. Everyone who has Code has a tip card. Your tip card can go in your social profile on TikTok, Twitch, etc. You can send it via a messaging app. Or, like I just did, you can put in in a blog post.</p>\n<p>Micropayments has always been one of the most exciting onchain use cases for me. And as we are seeing all over web3 now, tipping is leading the charge for micropayments. I think that’s awesome.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.usv.com/writing/2024/09/code-tip-cards/\">Code Tip Cards</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.usv.com\">Union Square Ventures</a>.</p>","author":"Fred Wilson","siteTitle":"http://www.usv.com/feed","siteHash":"628cf95acf2204bb0b1633ad294b90483a47fc067742fc28c14bbe7ca7e45bd8","entryHash":"bfdbf741b894d0cd53a5dc8867129c50356369ef966ea150d934b27a020fa718","category":"Sites"}
