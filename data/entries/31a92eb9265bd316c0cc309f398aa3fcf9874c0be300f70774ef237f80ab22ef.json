Few things wound more deeply and syphon love more swiftly than the feeling of not being fully seen, of being exiled from your own totality by a simulacrum of love that showers adoration upon fragments deemed desirable, to the exclusion or grudging toleration of the rest of you. Any relationship worthy of the word “love” unfolds between two wholenesses and is resinous with respect — respect for the entirety of the person and everything that makes them themselves. </p>\n<p>The humanistic philosopher and psychologist <strong>Erich Fromm</strong> (March 23, 1900–March 18, 1980) takes up the question of what respect really means and what it looks like in his 1947 book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Man-Himself-Inquiry-Psychology-Ethics/dp/0805014039/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>Man for Himself: An Inquiry into the Psychology of Ethics</em></strong></a>.</p>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Art-Listening-Erich-Fromm/dp/0826406548/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/erichfromm_cosmos.jpg?resize=680%2C873&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"680\" height=\"873\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/erichfromm_cosmos.jpg?w=790&amp;ssl=1 790w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/erichfromm_cosmos.jpg?resize=240%2C308&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/erichfromm_cosmos.jpg?resize=320%2C411&amp;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/erichfromm_cosmos.jpg?resize=768%2C986&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/erichfromm_cosmos.jpg?resize=600%2C770&amp;ssl=1 600w\" /></a><figcaption>Erich Fromm</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Fromm writes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Care and responsibility are constituent elements of love, but without respect for and knowledge of the beloved person, love deteriorates into domination and possessiveness… To respect a person is not possible without knowing him; care and responsibility would be blind if they were not guided by the knowledge of the person’s individuality.</p></blockquote>\n<p>But mutual knowledge — <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2015/01/07/tom-stoppard-the-real-thing-love/\">“the mask slipped from the face,”</a> in Tom Stoppard’s lovely phrase — takes time, takes constancy, takes a passionate curiosity undimmed by the fading of novelty. Respect, then, is a durational practice rooted in the commitment to know one another more deeply and accept more fully what is discovered in the depths. </p>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2022/05/12/sophie-blackall-things-to-look-forward-to/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/sophieblackall_thingstolookforwardto_FallinginLove.jpg?resize=680%2C811&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"680\" height=\"811\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/sophieblackall_thingstolookforwardto_FallinginLove.jpg?w=1161&amp;ssl=1 1161w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/sophieblackall_thingstolookforwardto_FallinginLove.jpg?resize=320%2C382&amp;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/sophieblackall_thingstolookforwardto_FallinginLove.jpg?resize=600%2C716&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/sophieblackall_thingstolookforwardto_FallinginLove.jpg?resize=240%2C286&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/sophieblackall_thingstolookforwardto_FallinginLove.jpg?resize=768%2C916&amp;ssl=1 768w\" /></a><figcaption>Art by Sophie Blackall from <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2022/05/12/sophie-blackall-things-to-look-forward-to/\"><em>Things to Look Forward to</em></a></figcaption></figure>\n<p>A decade later, Fromm deepened the inquiry into the nature of respect in his timelessly rewarding book <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2015/10/29/the-art-of-loving-erich-fromm/\"><strong><em>The Art of Loving</em></strong></a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Respect is not fear and awe; it denotes, in accordance with the root of the word (<em>respicere</em> = to look at), the ability to see a person as he is, to be aware of his unique individuality.
