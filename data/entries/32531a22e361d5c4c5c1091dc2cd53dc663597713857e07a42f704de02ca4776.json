What you see when you go to scripting.com. I'm putting the same kind of attention into it that I did for the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2024/03/13/010313.html\">blogroll</a> feed reader earlier this year. There are a few unreleased products that use the same approach. The way we read the web hasn't received enough attention, we've been so focused on the twitter-like interfaces, forgetting that reading on a full page is important too. We've settled for a pretty awful way of reading. I want to fix writing too, and have plans for this, but I thought I should do some work on reading as well.
