Would we want it any other way? </p>\n<p>Imagine if everyone had to reinvent everything that anyone had ever invented just to make something new. </p>\n<p>There is a lot of that in software, people won't put in an API so you have to rebuild the whole house just to get a window. </p>\n<p>We can make progress when people don't try to lock up their ideas. </p>\n<p>Individuals live just a short time, we can't do that much in a lifetime, but we are an amazing species, because we leave behind what we learn and we build. </p>\n<p></p><div><img src=\"https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/03/05/selfportrait.png\" />We learn by studying ourselves.</div><p></p>\n<p>So why shouldn't our machines be able to learn too?
