I think the juiciest detail is that negotiations between TikTok and the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) broke down around August 2022. Which definitely changes the framing of this a bit. Though, that hasn’t stopped TikTok from citing all the recent anti-TikTok rhetoric from US lawmakers in their suit.</p><p><b>Apple </b><a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/apple-is-sorry-about-that-crushing-ipad-pro-ad-we-missed-the-mark?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=a-lot-of-furry-news-this-week\" target=\"_blank\"><b>apologized</b></a><b> for their horrible ad. </b>Their official statement was that they “missed the mark” with the ad. I, actually, don’t think people would have cared as much if Apple was doing literally anything that people would be excited about. People don’t want thinner iPads, they clearly want <i>something</i> new and I’m not so sure American tech companies know how to do that anymore.</p><p><b>Nintendo will </b><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-is-done-paying-elon-musk-for-x-integration-165704399.html?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=a-lot-of-furry-news-this-week\" target=\"_blank\"><b>no longer support</b></a><b> directly posting to X.</b> X’s Gaming account is denying that anything is happening, which is weird, but everything about that haunted company is weird. It’s not a surprise that companies like Nintendo aren’t integrating with X anymore. Their API costs $40,000 a month to use and the only people who are going to see your content are, you know, the worst human beings alive.</p><p><b>Jack Dorsey </b><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/jack-dorsey-claims-bluesky-is-repeating-all-the-mistakes-he-made-at-twitter-234326121.html?src=rss&amp;utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=a-lot-of-furry-news-this-week\" target=\"_blank\"><b>has broken rank</b></a><b> with Bluesky. </b>He’s left Bluesky’s board and is also back on X, posting a bunch of shady culture war shit.</p><p><b>Threads </b><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/9/24152926/threads-view-count-feature-now-available?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=a-lot-of-furry-news-this-week\" target=\"_blank\"><b>is adding</b></a><b> view counts.</b> This is probably a good place to put that my Threads referral traffic has completely cratered, as I knew it would. The decision to show view counts is, I assume, part of the typical Meta tactic to get people to care more about on-site engagement that any kind of real traffic.</p><h2>WEB3 AND THE METAVERSE</h2><p><b>The first Neuralink test has, inevitably, </b><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/05/elon-musks-neuralink-reports-trouble-with-first-human-brain-chip/?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=a-lot-of-furry-news-this-week\" target=\"_blank\"><b>broken</b></a><b>.</b> The threads of the implant have “retracted” from Noland Arbaugh’s brain, possibly due to air getting trapped in Arbaugh’s skull during surgery.

The important thing here is that Knocked Loose have not softened their sound. They actually keep getting heavier and less mainstream with each release. Though, that hasn’t stopped the brilliant minds over at r/hardcore from debating whether they count as “real hardcore” still.</p><p><b>There’s a campaign </b><a href=\"https://www.dailydot.com/pop-culture/digitine-blocking-celebrity-tiktok-digital-guillotine/?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=a-lot-of-furry-news-this-week\" target=\"_blank\"><b>to block celebrities</b></a><b> on TikTok. </b>They’re calling it a digital guillotine lol. I’d file this in the same category as Knocked Loose getting heavier and also more popular. Fame is changing and a lot of major celebrities are not prepared for where it’s headed (the early 90s basically).</p><h2>STREAMERS</h2><p><b>Disney Plus, Hulu, and Max </b><b><a href=\"https://variety.com/2024/digital/news/disney-plus-hulu-max-bundle-1235996533/?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=a-lot-of-furry-news-this-week\" target=\"_blank\">made a cable bundle</a></b><b>. </b>One that, crucially, doesn’t pay anyone <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SamHaft/status/1788414126877995266?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=a-lot-of-furry-news-this-week\" target=\"_blank\">any residuals</a>. </p><p><b>The results of Kendrick/Drake beef </b><a href=\"https://variety.com/vip/streaming-big-three-rap-beef-data-1235989096/?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=a-lot-of-furry-news-this-week\" target=\"_blank\"><b>are in</b></a><b>.</b> Lamar’s streams are up almost 20% and Drake’s are down almost 5%.

Fans doxxed her because the show used her tweets verbatim in the show. Which seems like the bare minimum of what NOT to do if you were trying to stop viewers from finding her online.</p><h2>MEMES AND TRENDS</h2><p><b>Charli XCX’s </b><b><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJW-VvmRKsE&amp;utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=a-lot-of-furry-news-this-week\" target=\"_blank\">new video</a></b><b> is full of “hot internet girls”. </b>The video is, as one X user <a href=\"https://twitter.com/horse_updates/status/1788634812623802590?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=a-lot-of-furry-news-this-week\" target=\"_blank\">put it</a>, “<i>Ocean’s 8</i> for people with crumbs in their bed (complimentary).”</p><p><b>A redditor in r/NuclearEngineering </b><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/NuclearEngineering/comments/1ccs4hh/attracting_too_many_furries/?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=a-lot-of-furry-news-this-week\" target=\"_blank\"><b>has a problem</b></a><b>.</b> They say that they are “attracting too many furries” and can’t stop getting hit on by furries when they reveal that they’re an engineer. This doesn’t seem like a problem to me???</p><h2>DRAMA</h2><p><b>The right-wing moral panic over NPR is not really working.</b> The TL;DR is that a bunch of conservative agitators are trying to paint NPR as a totalitarian mouthpiece for the woke left. It’s not working because NPR <a href=\"https://www.threads.net/@brandyzadrozny/post/C6tVkoluXoC?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=a-lot-of-furry-news-this-week\" target=\"_blank\">didn’t capitulate</a> and stayed firm amid the dogpile.

I’m paraphrasing an X post that some weird conservative account wrote to scare people about China which was, I think, broadly true. Which is that in the US, the car, philosophically, is a house you drive around. While in China, EV manufacturers are treating them like giant smartphones.</p><p><b>Indian politicians </b><a href=\"https://restofworld.org/2024/dead-relatives-ai-deepfake-india/?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=a-lot-of-furry-news-this-week\" target=\"_blank\"><b>are resurrecting</b></a><b> dead people with AI to campaign for them. </b>And it’s not just dead celebrities, but people’s relatives. Indian elections tend to set the narrative for election tech going forward, like Narendra Modi’s 2014 Facebook-powered win did in 2014. And if this election is any indication, AI is the next wave. </p><h2>SOME FUN STUFF</h2><ul><li><p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/C501lFTr49y/?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=a-lot-of-furry-news-this-week\" target=\"_blank\">Dance with the wizard</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/5teviem/status/1788841375460450523?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=a-lot-of-furry-news-this-week\" target=\"_blank\">I love this sesame rice bowl</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/track/6iVktfzbAvfPk55LaLVXIZ?si=f722be0053594afe&amp;utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=a-lot-of-furry-news-this-week\" target=\"_blank\">El BBL</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/C6QmOc7u9sE/?igsh=ZHdoZDlnYzJxd3Jl&amp;utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=a-lot-of-furry-news-this-week\" target=\"_blank\">Good bird vid</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheBlackHokage/status/1788811946097299754?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=a-lot-of-furry-news-this-week\" target=\"_blank\"><b>My Chemical BBL</b></a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@kattkelly/video/7366738736958164267?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=a-lot-of-furry-news-this-week\" target=\"_blank\">A truly unfortunate Etsy purchase</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@gesiellydossantos/video/7259223351120416005?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=a-lot-of-furry-news-this-week\" target=\"_blank\">Some good capybara content</a></p></li></ul><hr /><p>P.S. here’s <a href=\"https://www.tumblr.com/sandmandaddy69/748832911094169600?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=a-lot-of-furry-news-this-week\" target=\"_blank\">a very powerful image</a>.</p><p><i>***Any typos in this email are purpose actually, but with more of carefree weekend vibe***</i></p></div><div><br /><hr /><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.beehiiv.com/?utm_campaign=262a6794-33ed-4f3d-b4df-e3c57c365742&amp;utm_medium=post_rss&amp;utm_source=garbage_day\">Powered by beehiiv</a></div></div>","author":"Ryan Broderick","siteTitle":"Garbage Day","siteHash":"f6f2268f28b352c16d6836ba0dcf62d1334588ef4ccbdcbdd896fc6dd07bbcb7","entryHash":"6611be30ea5306fdb60ef0f373fbb00271b2c31d836fdfd1fa5804a7bcb99633","category":"default"}
