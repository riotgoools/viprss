I don't mind doing hard work, I just don't want to hear what the NYT-centered media has to say because it's all <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2024/08/11/bullshit2.m4a\">bullshit</a>. If I have to listen to nonstop bullshit, I'd rather hear from people who tell me we can have a bright future, than the usual NYT-spawned <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2024/08/11/bullshit2.m4a\">bullshit</a>. It's just <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2024/08/11/bullshit2.m4a\">bullshit</a>. I'm tired of <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2024/08/11/bullshit2.m4a\">bullshit</a>. That's all I have to say about <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2024/08/11/bullshit2.m4a\">bullshit</a> for now at least. Have a nice day.","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"564d71bc1adededf9710a5c2ef5e005ac421ab1a5872e48f6c35e6e6d40fd943","category":"default"}
