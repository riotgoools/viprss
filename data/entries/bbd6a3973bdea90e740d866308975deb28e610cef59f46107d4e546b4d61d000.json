But the problem is even worse. Holtzheimer seems to think that treatments spring from the lab perfectly formed like Athena springing from the brow of Zeus. Indeed, Holtzheimer suggests that treatments should be kept in the lab until they are perfect. News flash: there are no perfect treatments–no drug or device in use today is completely known to be safe, fully effective, and used at its optimal efficacy. <strong>Not one</strong>. If we follow Holtzheimer’s counsel, we will never approve a new drug.</p>\r\n<p>Innovation is a dynamic process; success rarely comes on the first attempt. The key to innovation is continuous refinement and improvement. A firm with sales gains greater resources to invest in further research and development. Additionally, they benefit from customer feedback, which provides valuable insights for enhancing their products and processes. Learning by doing requires doing. But if imperfect treatments are never approved, scientists often don’t return to the lab to refine and improve them. Instead, the project dies. Thus, when considering innovation today, it’s essential to think about not only the current state of technology but also about the entire trajectory of development. A treatment that’s marginally better today may be much better tomorrow.</p>\r\n<p>Small steps toward a much better world.</p>\r\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/06/the-marginal-revolution-theory-of-innovation.html\">The Marginal Revolution Theory of Innovation</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com\">Marginal REVOLUTION</a>.</p>\r\n<img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/899080511/0/marginalrevolution\" />\r\n<div><a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/899080511/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/899080511/marginalrevolution,\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/899080511/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/x.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/899080511/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/899080511/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/06/the-marginal-revolution-theory-of-innovation.html#comments\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/comments20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/06/the-marginal-revolution-theory-of-innovation.html/feed\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/commentsrss20.png\" /></a> \r\n<div><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/06/the-marginal-revolution-theory-of-innovation.html#comments\"><h3>Comments</h3></a><ul><li><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/06/the-marginal-revolution-theory-of-innovation.html#comment-160765754\">If you want to know why you’re wrong, read about aducanumab. ...</a> <i>by D.M.</i></li><li><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/06/the-marginal-revolution-theory-of-innovation.html#comment-160765722\">I've seen mdma therapy work wonders with many people in my life ...</a> <i>by Ringo</i></li><li><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/06/the-marginal-revolution-theory-of-innovation.html#comment-160765717\">In reply to Lawyer.
