You keep a diary so people who come through there next year and the year after will know what you tried and why it didn't work. Like using a GET when the RESTful thing is a POST. I once got excoriated by a famous security expert in public for doing this (XML-RPC only uses POST) but I had and have the best intentions. Back then in 1998, when I made the choice, I was juggling a billion flaming bowling pins. Back then there was no ChatGPT to ask about prior art. I had to move on. Well here we are again in 2024. I hope the next person traveling through the area in question sees what I didn't see. People who have worked on my code know that if you <a href=\"http://scripting.com/listings/pagepark.html\">read it in an outliner</a>, you'll see lots of blog posts with extensive <a href=\"https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/03/28/comments.png\">comments</a> that read more like a blog than software. Some functions have a thread of comments going back to the early 90s and not just from me. Outliners are great for writing code, because a long comment takes up exactly one line until you expand it. So you can go on and on and not stop until you're finished. Thank you and have a nice day. <span>ðŸ˜„</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"7e0a4afced9257d05ecd3ac4a2c44598588c896d250a694bea1eca3e8ad52288","category":"default"}
