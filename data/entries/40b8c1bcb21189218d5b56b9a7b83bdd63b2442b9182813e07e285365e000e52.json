{"title":"Tabarrok on China: World of DAAS Podcast","link":"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/902840606/0/marginalrevolution~Tabarrok-on-China-World-of-DAAS-Podcast.html","date":1723634348000,"content":"<p>I was very pleased to appear on Safegraph CEO Auren Hoffman’s <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.worldofdaas.com/p/alex-tabarrok\">World of DAAS podcast</a>. We covered lots of material including this (lightly edited) bit on China.</p>\r\n<blockquote><p><strong>Auren Hoffman</strong> (23:06.518):</p>\r\n<p>Now, you’ve thought a lot about things like reshoring, building manufacturing capacity. How do you think we could be thinking about that differently?</p>\r\n<p><strong>Alex</strong> (23:24.058)</p>\r\n<p>I understand that there are some concerns about China, and there is an argument and I think it’s a legitimate argument, that there are some things such as chips that we want to make sure, it’s not good to have them located in Taiwan, right? We want to make sure that we onshore those. However, I have three concerns. One is, fundamentally, I don’t think China and the United States have such a clash of interest. Of course, it’s not perfect harmony, but there’s a lot of harmony of interest between China and the United States. We do lot of trade with China, which benefits both China and the United States.</p>\r\n<p>..China’s getting richer Okay, people are worried because they’re getting more military whatever but also what this means is that people in China are getting cancer. <span>Well now there’s 1 .4 billion people who want to cure for cancer, and they’re willing to put some money into it, right? And then that’s going to increase the amount of research and development for all kinds of high-tech goods, which is amazing for us. Like, I would be thrilled if an American wins the Nobel Prize for curing cancer. I would be 99.5 % as happy if a Chinese scientist wins a Nobel Prize for curing cancer.</span></p>\r\n<p>So we have a lot to gain from a richer China. That’s point one. Point two is that, yeah, I get the idea that we want to onshore chip manufacturing, but I think we want to friendshore, right? So we don’t want to just have protection against all countries. Like I get it, okay, a hundred percent tariff on your Chinese EVs. It’s kind of crazy, but all right. However, let’s reduce tariffs on Germany.</p>\r\n<p>Let’s reduce tariffs on Europe. In fact, let’s create a free trade, even a free immigration block among the Western democracies, you know, including Japan, Australia, New Zealand. So, let’s not turn a small problem in foreign policy, which is to make sure that we have a ready military supply. Let’s not turn that into trying to create a fortress America Which is going to make us poorer and actually less safe instead, you know, let’s build up the free world. Okay, let’s create an immigration and free trade with Europe and Canada and Mexico and so forth. Let’s build up the free world. That’s point two.</p>\r\n<p>Point three is that look. It’s very, very easy to take a foreign policy argument and turn it into rent seeking for the benefit of special interests and protectionism for the benefit of special interests. Right? So at one point in the United States, probably even still today, you know, we were prohibiting mohair imports. Okay. Why? Because we use mohair to make military uniforms. The whole thing is ridiculous. But it’s very easy, almost inevitable, that this kind of argument is turned into a special interest trough.</p></blockquote>\r\n<p>I think this is one of my best podcast appearances because we covered some new material on crime, the universities, why Tyler and I are able to cooperate on so many projects, a conspiracy theory I believe and more.
