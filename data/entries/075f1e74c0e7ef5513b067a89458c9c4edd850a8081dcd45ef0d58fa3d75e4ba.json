The album’s second single, “Bored” (also good), came out last week, and the album itself is due out March 22. I haven’t been this excited for new music in as long as I can remember. I even ordered a t-shirt from the website (<a href=\"https://kf-merch.com/collections/waxahatchee/products/snow-cone-baseball-t-shirt\">two</a>, <a href=\"https://kf-merch.com/collections/waxahatchee/products/illustrated-snow-cone-t-shirt\">actually</a>) — the first time I’ve ever done that in my life!</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n        \n\n <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Katie%20Crutchfield\">Katie Crutchfield</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/music\">music</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/videos\">videos</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Waxahatchee\">Waxahatchee</a></p>\n\n <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/02/cool-new-music-waxahatchee-right-back-to-it-and-bored\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Edith Zimmerman","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"075f1e74c0e7ef5513b067a89458c9c4edd850a8081dcd45ef0d58fa3d75e4ba","category":"default"}
