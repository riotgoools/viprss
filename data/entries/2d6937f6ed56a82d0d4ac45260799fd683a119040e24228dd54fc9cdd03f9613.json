We hear them crying to us,” Muriel Rukeyser writes in her <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2020/12/14/muriel-rukeyser-the-life-of-poetry-in-crisis/\">timeless ode to the power of poetry</a>. “Cry, heart, but never break,” entreats <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2016/03/08/cry-heart-but-never-break/\">one of my favorite children’s books</a> — which, at their best, are always <a href=\"https://www.themorgan.org/programs/maria-popova-sophie-blackall-children’s-books-philosophy-living\" target=\"_blank\">philosophies for living</a>. It may be that our tears keep our hearts from breaking by making living poems of our pain, of our confusion, of the almost unbearable beauty of being. They are our singular evolutionary inheritance — we are the only animals with lacrimal glands activated by emotion — and our richest involuntary language. They are how we signal to each other what makes us and breaks us human: that we feel life deeply, that we are moved by moving through this world, that something, something that matters enough, has punctured our illusion of control just enough to open a pinhole into the incalculable fragility that grants life its bittersweet beauty. To cry is to claim our humanity, to claim our very lives. It is an indelible part of mastering what the humanistic philosopher and psychologist Erich Fromm called <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2016/03/23/erich-fromm-the-art-of-living/\">“the art of living.”</a></p>\n<p>That is what Argentine visual artist Pepita Sandwich explores in <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Art-Crying-Healing-Power-Tears/dp/031653255X/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>The Art of Crying: The Healing Power of Tears</em></strong></a> (<a href=\"https://search.worldcat.org/title/10072848\" target=\"_blank\"><em>public library</em></a>) — part memoir of a lacrimal life, part investigation of the creaturely and cultural function of tears, part manifesto for unabashed crying as a radical act of emotional intelligence. </p>\n<p><a

kinds of tears we produce: basal tears (the lubricant that makes our vision possible), reflex tears (the body’s cleansing response to irritation and foreign particles), and emotional tears (those “custodians of the heart,” as she calls them, biologically unique to the human animal). </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Art-Crying-Healing-Power-Tears/dp/031653255X/?tag=braipick-20\"

machine of reactions between the amygdala, the hypothalamus, and the autonomic nervous system — that does not require tears: We are born without fully developed lacrimal glands and can’t produce tears for the first two months of life, yet new babies dry-cry just the same to express their physiological and emotional needs. </p>\n<p>The history of tears emanates the history of science itself, of our yearning to know what we are and what the world is, with all our misguided guesses along the way.</p>\n<p><a

Galean notion that tears were “the humors of the heart,” to the medieval belief that tears were a tonic that could cure infections and release souls from purgatory, to Darwin’s <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2011/11/11/darwins-camera/\">studies of emotional expressions</a>, which led him to believe that tears gave us an evolutionary advantage in being able to signal for help but puzzled him in their positive manifestation.<br />\nWe cry when we need to be held, yes — the tears of distress, signaling a need for comfort — but we also cry at what we cannot hold — the tears of joy and awe, which Darwin himself barely held back in <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2024/05/19/darwin-messiah/\">his encounter with the spiritual aspect of raw nature</a>. Pepita recalls weeping before one of the world’s largest waterfalls, not knowing how to hold and how else to express her overflowing joy at the transcendent spectacle. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Art-Crying-Healing-Power-Tears/dp/031653255X/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/artofcrying16.jpg?resize=680%2C607&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"680\" height=\"607\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/artofcrying16.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/artofcrying16.jpg?resize=320%2C286&amp;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/artofcrying16.jpg?resize=600%2C536&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/artofcrying16.jpg?resize=240%2C214&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/artofcrying16.jpg?resize=768%2C686&amp;ssl=1 768w\" /></a></p>\n<p>This kind of crying betokens what Iris Murdoch so wonderfully termed <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2019/10/21/iris-murdoch-unselfing/\">“an occasion for unselfing,”</a> locating its twin springs in nature and in art. To cry before a painting, at the movies, or while listening to music is training ground for empathy. (The word <em>empathy</em> itself only <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2016/12/14/you-must-change-rilke-rodin-empathy/\">came into popular use in the early twentieth century</a> to describe the imaginative act of projecting oneself into a work of art in an effort to understand why art moves us.)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Art-Crying-Healing-Power-Tears/dp/031653255X/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/artofcrying10.jpg?resize=680%2C623&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"680\" height=\"623\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/artofcrying10.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/artofcrying10.jpg?resize=320%2C293&amp;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/artofcrying10.jpg?resize=600%2C550&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/artofcrying10.jpg?resize=240%2C220&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/artofcrying10.jpg?resize=768%2C704&amp;ssl=1 768w\" /></a></p>\n<p>This is why crying may be a precious foothold on our own humanity in an age of artificial intelligence that makes the criteria for consciousness increasingly slippery.

Marginalian</em> (which <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2021/10/22/brain-pickings-becoming-the-marginalian/\">bore the outgrown name <em>Brain Pickings</em></a> for its first fifteen years). It has remained free and ad-free and alive thanks to patronage from readers. I have no staff, no interns, no assistant — a thoroughly one-woman labor of love that is also my life and my livelihood. If this labor makes your own life more livable in any way, please consider lending a helping hand with a <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/donate/\">donation</a>. Your support makes all the difference.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3>newsletter</h3>\n<p><em>The Marginalian</em> has a free weekly newsletter.
