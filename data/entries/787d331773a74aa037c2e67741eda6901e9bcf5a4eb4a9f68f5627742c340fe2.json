The NY Times wrote about <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/03/style/a-new-wave-of-appreciation-for-the-man-who-drew-new-york.html?unlocked_article_code=1.pE0.tVkO.-WbV6lwRYjTF\">the effort to preserve his legacy</a>.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>Jen Bekman, the founder of the online gallery 20x200, reflected on Mr. Polan’s legacy while she sat beside his sketches.</p>\n\n<p>“These are not doodles,” Ms. Bekman said. “That word is diminishing. People remember him as an illustrator, but Jason was a great artist, and his practice was his life.”</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>I “lost” a bunch of time <a href=\"https://www.wright20.com/auctions/2024/05/i-want-to-know-all-of-you-the-art-collection-of-jason-polan\">browsing through the collection this morning</a>, which includes both work by Polan and things he collected &amp; received from other artists.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/polan-auction-02.jpg\" srcset=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=500,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/polan-auction-02.jpg 500w, /cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/polan-auction-02.jpg 1200w\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1300\" height=\"1602\" alt=\"drawing of a woman holding balloons\" /></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/polan-auction-03.jpg\" srcset=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=500,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/polan-auction-03.jpg 500w, /cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/polan-auction-03.jpg 1200w\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1300\" height=\"1708\" alt=\"drawing of some of the art in the Museum of Modern Art\" /></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/polan-auction-04.jpg\" srcset=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=500,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/polan-auction-04.jpg 500w, /cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/polan-auction-04.jpg 1200w\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1300\" height=\"1951\" alt=\"drawing of Greta Gerwig walking down the street\" /></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/polan-auction-05.jpg\" srcset=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=500,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/polan-auction-05.jpg 500w, /cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/polan-auction-05.jpg 1200w\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1300\" height=\"988\" alt=\"two drawings of people on the NYC subway\" /></p>\n\n<p>It’s great to see Polan’s legacy being preserved and his art being spread around the world. And to be reminded of <a href=\"https://everypersoninnewyork.blogspot.com/2015/02/i-got-call-earlier-today-to-go-to-new.html\">that time he went to a fashion show</a>.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>I sort of stood still because I was a little confused as to what just happened. Kim walked right by me. Puff Daddy took a picture with someone right in front of me. I then saw Beyoncé walking toward me and I said, “Hi Beyoncé,” and she said, “Heeey,” and smiled and it was kind of like having a Bar Mitzvah. Then Jay Z walked by and I said, “Hi Jay,” and in the second I said that I thought, am I supposed to add a Z? but didn’t and he said hey but not as beautifully as Beyoncé. I love her so much. I drew a couple more people and then went outside and forgot where I was and then walked to the train and went home.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Reminder: <a href=\"https://20x200.com/collections/jason-polan\">you can buy prints and things of Polan’s work at 20x200</a>. I have several of these, including <a href=\"https://20x200.com/collections/jason-polan/products/zoo-baggu\">the Zoo Baggu</a>, which I get compliments on almost every time I use it for grocery shopping.</p>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/art\">art</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Jason%20Polan\">Jason Polan</a></p>\n\n         <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/05/jason-polan-i-want-to-know-all-of-you\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"787d331773a74aa037c2e67741eda6901e9bcf5a4eb4a9f68f5627742c340fe2","category":"default"}
