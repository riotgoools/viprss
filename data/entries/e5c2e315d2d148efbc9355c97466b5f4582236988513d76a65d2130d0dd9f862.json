It runs for a week starting on January 16, 2023, finishing on January 23.\nFive months ago, during the peak of summer heat, I ran the first TOKIO TŌKYŌ TOKYO newsletter. Despite sweating some five liters each day, I had a blast. It reminded me of many things — not the least of which being my complex twenty-three year history with the city — but mostly it reminded me of how much I love Tokyo.","author":"","siteTitle":"Craig Mod","siteHash":"7358923c3192bccfb6b9f0032f475bef5140f12de0f235c80ca3d98e1a3d393b","entryHash":"e5c2e315d2d148efbc9355c97466b5f4582236988513d76a65d2130d0dd9f862","category":"default"}
