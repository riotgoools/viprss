Chicago, thanks to high penetration and lower prices of broadband, has the best digital life score, followed by Minneapolis and Oklahoma City. San Francisco came in at number 22 on the overall list.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This new study by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.trgdatacenters.com\">TRG Datacenters</a> assessed the digital quality of life across U.S. cities by measuring metrics such as download speed, number of internet service providers, and customer ratings. The study also considered data such as searches for internet issues, internet costs, broadband penetration, and cybercrime rates. Then, each city’s composite Digital Quality of Life Score was calculated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The download speeds received the highest weight of 25 percent when calculating the digital score. Penetration came in second with a 20 percent weight. Internet prices for 60 Mbps or more accounted for 10 percent of the score.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><table><tbody><tr><td>City</td><td>Download Speed</td><td>Prices of Internet</td><td>BB penetration by City </td><td>Composite Score </td></tr><tr><td>Chicago</td><td>2,342</td><td>$58.40</td><td>99.0%</td><td>42.73</td></tr><tr><td>Minneapolis</td><td>2,697</td><td>$67.18</td><td>98.7%</td><td>42.71</td></tr><tr><td>Oklahoma City</td><td>3,084</td><td>$68.85</td><td>99.2%</td><td>41.35</td></tr><tr><td>Kansas City</td><td>4,038</td><td>$65.50</td><td>98.6%</td><td>41.09</td></tr><tr><td>Houston</td><td>3,667</td><td>$66.71</td><td>98.9%</td><td>40.43</td></tr><tr><td>Dallas</td><td>3,628</td><td>$66.61</td><td>97.6%</td><td>39.54</td></tr><tr><td>Portland</td><td>2,803</td><td>$65.10</td><td>98.9%</td><td>39.44</td></tr><tr><td>Denver</td><td>1,985</td><td>$66.59</td><td>99.1%</td><td>38.85</td></tr><tr><td>New York City</td><td>4,094</td><td>$68.20</td><td>100.0%</td><td>38.66</td></tr><tr><td>Tulsa</td><td>2,517</td><td>$67.40</td><td>98.5%</td><td>37.98</td></tr><tr><td>Indianapolis</td><td>3,909</td><td>$66.35</td><td>98.9%</td><td>37.77</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>November 25, 2024.</strong></em></p>","author":"Om Malik","siteTitle":"Om Malik","siteHash":"56aa7c22de1a9e5680d03082a2a13db78fe214c96b8119e8d54042cbf2d355ae","entryHash":"7e6b893c36f9701628b056d972be9ad1bb6825bd0df8e66928717b5c8c7312f9","category":"Sites"}
