But I must have had a look on my face because he shook his head and laughed. “Don’t worry, I’ve got twin beds,” he said. With a grin he added, “And honestly, I don’t find you particularly attractive.” I was both insulted and relieved. And that’s how I became the potty-mouthed sidekick to a man eleven years older than me who was in the middle of a divorce.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>I hadn’t realized Sonny was so much older than Cher, who was 16 when they met, which, uh, yeah.
