The bears are called Harvard, Maple, Colorado, and Aspen, and I might be losing my mind because I stg there are 5 bears in this picture? Deputy Head of Carnivores, Tommy Babbington mused the bears were “immediately intrigued” by the boat, though admittedly I only quoted him here so I could use the phrase Deputy Head of Carnivores, Tommy Babbington, which is about the most best combination of job title and name I’ve ever heard.</p>\n\n<p>But for real, how many bears do you see?</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/bearsinswanboat.jpg\" srcset=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=500,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/bearsinswanboat.jpg 500w, /cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/bearsinswanboat.jpg 1200w\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" alt=\"bearsinswanboat.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>(via <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/presentcorrect.bsky.social/post/3kojjkse7b52f\">Present &amp; Correct</a>)</p>\n\n <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/bears\">bears</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/swans\">swans</a></p>\n\n <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/03/bears-in-a-boat\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Aaron Cohen","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"efa69a8fbbab59edf4546d50f0f2201d24963c5557c709d7c930721e0aedb1ba","category":"default"}
