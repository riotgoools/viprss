Conventionally described as a “p<span>sychological thriller,” or a horror movie it’s actually a Kafkaesque analysis of tenancy rights and the legal system. </span>The movie centers on a young couple, Drake and Patty, who purchase a San Francisco Victorian with dreams of fixing it up and renting several of the units to help pay the mortgage. Their dream turns into a nightmare  when Carter Hayes (Michael Keaton) moves in and exploits tenant protection laws to torment and exploit them.</p>\r\n<p>Hayes moves in without permission and without paying rent and he changes the locks. It doesn’t matter. When <span>Drake (Modine) shuts off the power and heat, Hayes calls the police and the police explain to Drake:</span></p>\r\n<blockquote><p><span>What you did is against the law….turn the power and heat back on and apologize because according to the California civil code he has a right to sue and most likely he will win. If he’s in, he has rights, that’s how it works.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>A lawyer later adds “He’s taken possession so whether he signed a lease or paid money or not he’s legally your tenant now and he is protected by laws that say you have to go to court to prove that he has to be evicted but the net effect of these laws is to…slowly drive you bankrupt and insane.”</span></p></blockquote>\r\n<p>What makes Pacific Heights a horror movie is that the tenant’s rights laws depicted are very real. Here’s just one example of thousands from NYC:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>NEW: New York City homeowner gets arrested after changing the locks on *her own home* after it got taken over by squatters.</p>\r\n<p>Never do business in New York.</p>\r\n<p>In NYC, anyone can simply claim \"squatter's rights\" after 30 days of living at a home which isn't even enough time for the… <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://t.co/xkcfYM9l7u\">pic.twitter.com/xkcfYM9l7u</a></p>\r\n<p>— Collin Rugg (@CollinRugg) <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://twitter.com/CollinRugg/status/1770124716294181126?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 19, 2024</a></p></blockquote>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>As I <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://x.com/ATabarrok/status/1770187164371783823?s=20\">wrote on twitter</a> “Decades of anti-landlord legislation has created a moocher-class of squatters who steal homes and then call the police on the owners.” Moreover, even today such laws continue to be added to the books. A bill in Congress, for example, would <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://theappeal.org/pressley-tlab-bill-limit-criminal-background-checks-on-renters/\">prevent landlords from being able to screen tenants for criminal records</a>.</p>\r\n<p>All of this has been exacerbated recently by COVID laws preventing eviction (<a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.nolo.com/evictions-ban\">some of which remain</a> but which acclimatized some tenants to not paying rent and contributed to court backlogs), court backlogs and the greater ease of finding unoccupied houses using foreclosure data, death announcements, Zillow and so forth. In extreme cases it <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.foxnews.com/us/long-island-man-who-hasnt-paid-his-mortgage-in-20-years-dodges-eviction-again\">can take decades</a> to evict a squatter who uses the law to their advantage.</p>\r\n<p>Returning to Pacific Heights, what the movie gets wrong is the second half where Patty (Melanie Griffith) extracts revenge against Hayes. A less cathartic but more accurate ending would have had the couple exhausted with the complexities of tenant law and the court system and finally giving up when they realize that the law is not for them. Instead, they pay Carter Hayes a ransom to leave their own home. Of course, Drake and Patty choose never to rent to anyone ever again.</p>\r\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/03/pacific-heights-a-movie-ahead-of-its-time.html\">Pacific Heights: A Movie Ahead of Its Time</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com\">Marginal REVOLUTION</a>.</p>\r\n<img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/874092098/0/marginalrevolution\" />\r\n<div><a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/874092098/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/874092098/marginalrevolution,\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/874092098/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/x.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/874092098/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/874092098/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/03/pacific-heights-a-movie-ahead-of-its-time.html#comments\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/comments20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/03/pacific-heights-a-movie-ahead-of-its-time.html/feed\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/commentsrss20.png\" /></a> \r\n<div><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/03/pacific-heights-a-movie-ahead-of-its-time.html#comments\"><h3>Comments</h3></a><ul><li><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/03/pacific-heights-a-movie-ahead-of-its-time.html#comment-160733169\">In reply to takaya.
