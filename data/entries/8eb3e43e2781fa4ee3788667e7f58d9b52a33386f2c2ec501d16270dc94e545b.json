I've tried to get people who make podcast clients to listen. Yes I am a user, but I also designed the technology, and did the first implementations, so I <i>know</i> what's possible. The medium could work so much better if they simply adopted the interests of their users. I never want to lock users into my products, I want them to choose them because they're the best.","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"8eb3e43e2781fa4ee3788667e7f58d9b52a33386f2c2ec501d16270dc94e545b","category":"Sites"}
