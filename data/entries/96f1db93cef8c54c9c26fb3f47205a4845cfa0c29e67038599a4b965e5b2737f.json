It could happen.<br />\nOr sunshine, love, salvation.</p>\n<p>It could, you know. That’s why we wake<br />\nand look out — no guarantees<br />\nin this life.</p>\n<p>But some bonuses, like morning,<br />\nlike right now, like noon,<br />\nlike evening.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Stafford had a late start as a poet — his first major collection was published when he was 48. And then the poems that had been writing themselves in him all his life came pouring out, spare and stunning. Within eight years, he was elected Poet Laureate of the United Staes. </p>\n<p>The morning before he died in the final year of his seventies, he drafted a poem containing these lines:</p>\n<blockquote><p>You can’t tell when strange things with meaning<br />\nwill happen. I’m [still] here writing it down<br />\njust the way it was. “You don’t have to<br />\nprove anything,” my mother said. “Just be ready<br />\nfor what God sends.” I listened and put my hand<br />\nout in the sun again. It was all easy.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Complement with Viktor Frankl, writing shortly after his release from the concentration camps, on <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2020/05/17/yes-to-life-in-spite-of-everything-viktor-frankl/\">saying “yes” to life in spite of everything</a> and Henry James on <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2022/10/17/henry-james-the-beast-in-the-jungle/\">how to stop waiting and start living</a>, then revisit Barbara Ras’s kindred poem <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2019/02/07/you-cant-have-it-all-barbara-ras-emily-levine/\">“You Can’t Have It All”</a> and Hannah Emerson’s <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2023/09/26/hannah-emerson-center-of-the-universe/\">cosmic howl of <em>yes yes yes</em></a>.</p>\n<hr /><h3>donating = loving</h3><p>For seventeen years, I have been spending hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars each month composing <em>The Marginalian</em> (which <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2021/10/22/brain-pickings-becoming-the-marginalian/\">bore the outgrown name <em>Brain Pickings</em></a> for its first fifteen years).
