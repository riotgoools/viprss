There is a link to a reservations page. It all looks like a pretty normal restaurant IG account. </p><p>But when you look closer, every single thing from the photos of the food, to the venue, is AI generated. The posts from the restaurant get thousands of likes and shares, many from people who don't seem to realize it's all fake. \"These are so cute! Tiny greens with big flavor,\" a business account for a micro greens company <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/Ethos_atx\">commented</a> on a recent post of AI generated micro greens. </p><p>\"This is some amazing food photography, everything looks impeccable,\" another user <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/Ethos_atx\">commented</a> on an AI generated photo of scallops. </p><p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/Ethos_atx\">The page</a> pushes users to <a href=\"https://www.ethosatx.net/merchandise\">a merchandise shop</a>, where <a href=\"https://shop.fitprint.io/printify-products-v2.html\">Ethos is selling more AI generated products</a>. There are fake, AI generated oil paintings of food, phone cases with AI generated images, t-shirts with AI generated art, stickers, and clothing with the Ethos brand name emblazoned on the front. </p><p><a href=\"https://www.usermag.co/subscribe?\"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p>It’s unclear what Ethos_atx’s ultimate goal is. “It’s either a scam or a delusional person trying to manifest their dream into existence without any actual path to success,” one Reddit user <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/austinfood/comments/138anes/ethos_ai_restaurant_update/\">posted</a> in one of several discussions about the page on the Austin food subreddit. </p><p>Role playing online isn't new, the administrator is likely making money from the merch, and clearly at least some portion of Ethos' fans are in on the joke. The restaurant's tagline is \"home of unreal flavors.\" When reached for comment, the restaurant joked they were preparing for a Michelin guide review and couldn't respond. Justine Moore, an investor in San Francisco, <a href=\"https://x.com/venturetwins/status/1845557195913761196\">noted</a> that the restaurant even has AI generated chefs. </p><p>But none of the AI generated content posted on the entire account is labeled as AI generated, and photos of AI food has become a plague on the culinary world. </p><div><p>“All these buzzy food items created to go viral on social media, have set people up to think to themselves, 'well maybe that 12 layer sandwich is a real thing and not AI.’”</p></div><p>Restaurants and food companies are increasingly leveraging AI generated images, generating hyper-realistic or fantastical dishes that might not even be possible in real life. Dozens of ghost kitchens <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/ghost-kitchens-are-advertising-ai-generated-food-on-doordash-and-grubhub/\">have been advertising AI generated menu items</a> on Doordash and Grubhub and Instacart was suggesting AI generated recipes for dishes with <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/instacarts-ai-recipes-look-literally-impossible/\">ingredients that don’t even exist</a>. </p><p>This barrage of AI generated food slop, paired with restaurant recommendation systems that are already easy to gamify, makes it harder and harder to know what’s a real eatery. Several years ago a man <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/i-made-my-shed-the-top-rated-restaurant-on-tripadvisor/\">made his backyard shed</a> the top rated restaurant on TripAdvisor. Last year, a restaurant named Mehran’s Steak House received a near-perfect Google rating. The restaurant never existed and <a href=\"https://archive.ph/H8twq#selection-675.0-678.0\">was all an elaborate joke</a>. </p><div><figure><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb9e93ae-7333-4c1b-874a-333839d29c49_1600x899.jpeg\"><div><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb9e93ae-7333-4c1b-874a-333839d29c49_1600x899.jpeg\" width=\"660\" height=\"370.7967032967033\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb9e93ae-7333-4c1b-874a-333839d29c49_1600x899.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb9e93ae-7333-4c1b-874a-333839d29c49_1600x899.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb9e93ae-7333-4c1b-874a-333839d29c49_1600x899.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb9e93ae-7333-4c1b-874a-333839d29c49_1600x899.jpeg 1456w\" loading=\"lazy\" /><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/thesussmans\">Eli Sussman</a>, the executive chef and partner at gertrude's, an IRL (and extremely delicious!) bistro in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, said that restaurant food in particular is becoming harder and harder to distinguish between AI and reality.

(This was the only pic we got together 😭).</p><div><figure><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/content-creators-2024-best-of-times-worst-1236026963/\"><div><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F84a3f384-46f8-43b7-88cb-5fb951d8e6e6_1038x1370.png\" width=\"288\" height=\"380.11560693641616\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F84a3f384-46f8-43b7-88cb-5fb951d8e6e6_1038x1370.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F84a3f384-46f8-43b7-88cb-5fb951d8e6e6_1038x1370.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F84a3f384-46f8-43b7-88cb-5fb951d8e6e6_1038x1370.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F84a3f384-46f8-43b7-88cb-5fb951d8e6e6_1038x1370.png 1456w\" loading=\"lazy\" /><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>I wrote two big print stories for <em>The Hollywood Reporter’s</em> Creators issue: <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/content-creators-2024-best-of-times-worst-1236026963/\">a state of the creator economy” type main piece</a> that went alongside the big influencer photoshoot and <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/faceless-content-creators-viral-1236026970/\">a piece of the rise of faceless influencers</a>.</p><div><figure><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/content-creators-2024-best-of-times-worst-1236026963/\"><div><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc9c368cf-bfe1-4fdc-9641-3443d5df47be_1440x1063.jpeg\" width=\"516\" height=\"380.90833333333336\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc9c368cf-bfe1-4fdc-9641-3443d5df47be_1440x1063.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc9c368cf-bfe1-4fdc-9641-3443d5df47be_1440x1063.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc9c368cf-bfe1-4fdc-9641-3443d5df47be_1440x1063.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc9c368cf-bfe1-4fdc-9641-3443d5df47be_1440x1063.jpeg 1456w\" loading=\"lazy\" /><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>That’s it for now!
