Seriously? SERIOUSLY.</p>\n<p>I've been black my whole life so I'm used to people smiling in my face and\ncursing my existence in the same breath. <em>yawn</em></p>\n<p>I let my guard down and assumed because I was in a smart space with bright people\nworking towards a brighter future for us all that we'd ALL be on the same page.\nIdk wtf y'all think anymore and nor do I care at this point.</p>\n<p>Farcaster is a neat experiment that had potential to work. Now I see it will\nnever work. You cannot be a network for everybody when you don't give a shit\nabout every body. Glazing and posturing for Daddy Elon when he don't even respect\nhis own kids is sick work.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>My good friend Brad Barrish shared an excellent blog post from Ken White<a href=\"https://www.popehat.com/p/and-yet-it-moves\">2</a> in\nresponse. As one commenter put it, it's the best post-mortem of the election that\nI've seen yet. Honestly, it's a must-read. Check it out, you'll thank me later.</p>\n<p>ðŸ•¸</p>\n<hr />\n","author":"","siteTitle":"the webb blog","siteHash":"d87386c8de21b16d23a4d22ceb0991728c5b4e4486d627490c6fcde14e563300","entryHash":"18d99dbad94905ab1da4e6f4c0dea37ee185de5db1e490b462b87b2de390ed0e","category":"Sites"}
