I introduced my kids to Taj√≠n-coated peach gummies after a trip to Oakland in 2018, and my two year called them Fire Cheerios because all round foods were Cheerios then. Taj√≠n is also good on mango ice cream, or anything really. </p>\n\n<blockquote><p>Mexican chilito candies, or dulces enchilados, have been making the mouths of Texans pucker for at least as long as we‚Äôve been hitting pi√±atas. A colloquial catchall for a variety of sweets, chilito refers to the spice of chamoy, a traditional Mexican paste made from pickled fruits and spices. Chilito can come as a condiment, like on fruit bowls or elote; with the addition of powdered sugar, it can be thick and sticky, perfect for coating hard candy. Dulceros, or candymakers, also control the degree of spice‚Äîfrom a pleasant pop on the tastebuds to a fiery shock‚Äîby manipulating the amount and types of chiles in the chamoy. It‚Äôs as acidic as it is addictive, and a favorite amongst Tejano snackers. ‚ÄúCustomers go crazy for it,‚Äù says Rick Samame, one of the owners of Alamo Candy Company in San Antonio, the largest purveyor of all things chilito in the state. </p></blockquote>\n\n<p><img src=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/chilitospicatemucho.jpg\" srcset=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=500,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/chilitospicatemucho.jpg 500w, /cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/chilitospicatemucho.jpg 1200w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"chilitospicatemucho.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<blockquote><p>Take the chilito Gusher, a prime example of Mexican American confectionary fusion. Officially branded as Fruit Gushers, the Betty Crocker‚Äìowned snack has been synonymous with American childhood since the famous ‚Äô90s commercials that featured teens‚Äô heads turning into various fruits after popping Gushers in their mouths. One could imagine a similar commercial for chilito Gushers, except the teens‚Äô watermelon- and raspberry-shaped heads would now also be on fire. The soft, chewy candies filled with sugary fruit juice are addictive enough, but with the added heat and texture of the spiced chamoy and chili powder, they‚Äôre transformed into something entirely new, something that is both Mexican and American.</p></blockquote>\n\n <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/candy\">candy</a></p>\n\n <p>üí¨ <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/03/chilito-candy\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> ‚Üí</p>\n\n    ","author":"Aaron Cohen","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"551c09922a60ea0a8670dc82b964933ac0d96d92a67d6cbec7be57196a925c46","category":"default"}
