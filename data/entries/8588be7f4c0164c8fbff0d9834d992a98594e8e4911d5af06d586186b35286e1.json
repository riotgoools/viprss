The warming effect of the sun was greater for compressed air than for an evacuated tube and greater for moist air than dry air. “Thirdly, the highest effect of the sun’s rays I have found to be in carbonic acid gas.” (carbon dioxide) She continued: “An atmosphere of that gas would give to our earth a high temperature; and if, as some suppose, at one period of its history, the air had mixed with it a larger proportion than at present, an increased temperature from its action, as well as from an increased weight, must have necessarily resulted.”</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Foote’s paper went largely unnoticed until it was rediscovered in the last decade. If you’re interested, the best thing I’ve read on the history of climate change is the 7th chapter of Charles Mann’s <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0307961699/ref=nosim/0sil8\">The Wizard and the Prophet</a>.</p>\n\n        \n\n <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/books\">books</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/climate%20crisis\">climate crisis</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Eunice%20Foote\">Eunice Foote</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/science\">science</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/The%20Wizard%20and%20the%20Prophet\">The Wizard and the Prophet</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/XKCD\">XKCD</a></p>\n\n <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/02/our-missed-headstart-on-the-climate-crisis\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"8588be7f4c0164c8fbff0d9834d992a98594e8e4911d5af06d586186b35286e1","category":"default"}
