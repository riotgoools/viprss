It happens on its own. Look at all the time and energy <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee\">TBL</a> put into <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web\">reinventing</a> the web. Never happened, and he's the guy who got the web started in the first place. I've been there when something small became huge and real, twice actually. But I couldn't tell you why, I just have theories. I called it \"media hacking\" at the time. Create a new media type and put it out there to see if it would stick. After a while nothing would stick because the pipes were controlled by Twitter, Google and Facebook and they weren't sharing. Now we're kind of letting Facebook own the pipes Twitter used to own. Maybe. So many people appear to be fooled into thinking FB is doing something open. They should learn the rules of tech, it's nowhere near as complicated as football or basketball. If everyone wants to interop with one company, nothing open can come out of that. Threads became the thing people wanted to interop with a couple of days after it came into existence. Now it must be orders of magnitude greater than Mastodon, and it's not going to hit any scaling walls because they've already scaled it, in every way. There's still time, I think, for new ideas, but maybe not much time. We'll see.","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"0a2fbaa26cf6972e747ac6261d58d4e5e8c32020abfae677c42e2f7e9a204638","category":"default"}
