I like that thereâ€™s no music or voiceover, so you can hear the sounds of the production. I also enjoyed the charmingly janky English subtitles:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>Blah blah powder for hardness. Yellow powder for pure white color. Irony, huh?!</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Can someone who knows something about making candles tell me why that hole is made in each of the candles with the metal rods? It was unclear from the video what its purpose is.</p>\n\n<p>If youâ€™d like to ruin/enhance the rest of your day, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@Factory_Monster/videos?view=0&amp;sort=p&amp;shelf_id=0\">Factory Monster has a trove of making-of videos</a> shot in Korean factories and workshops: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOLxhT74Vxg\">retreading old tires</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQMhv5XAdOc\">distressed jeans</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT6KRkoNWMY\">chain link fences</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gg52KK4Qn1s\">customized Vans sneakers</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slJFkvAjccg\">making a knife from an old motorcycle chain</a>.
