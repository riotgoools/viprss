In fact, the Chinese vaccines such as <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CoronaVac\">Coronavac/Sinovac</a> were made quickly and in large quantities and they were effective. The Chinese vaccines saved <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19-vaccines-saved-estimated-20-million-lives-1-year\">millions of lives</a>. <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pandp.20211103\">The vaccine portfolio model</a> that the AHT team produced, as well as common sense, suggested the value of having a diversified portfolio. That’s why we recommended and <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2020/06/operation-warp-speed-needs-to-go-to-warp-10.html\">I advocated</a> for including a deactivated vaccine in the Operation Warp Speed mix or barring that for making an advance deal on vaccine capacity with China. At the time, I assumed that the disparaging of Chinese vaccines was simply an issue of national pride or bravado during a time of fear. But it turns out that in other countries, <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-covid-propaganda/?utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_source=twitter\">the Pentagon ran a disinformation campaign against the Chinese vaccines</a>.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Reuters: At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. military launched a secret campaign to counter what it perceived as China’s growing influence in the Philippines, a nation hit especially hard by the deadly virus.</p>\r\n<p>The clandestine operation has not been previously reported. It aimed to sow doubt about the safety and efficacy of vaccines and other life-saving aid that was being supplied by China, a Reuters investigation found. Through phony internet accounts meant to impersonate Filipinos, the military’s propaganda efforts morphed into an anti-vax campaign.</p>\r\n<p>… Tailoring the propaganda campaign to local audiences across Central Asia and the Middle East, the Pentagon used a combination of fake social media accounts on multiple platforms to spread fear of China’s vaccines among Muslims at a time when the virus was killing tens of thousands of people each day. A key part of the strategy: amplify the disputed contention that, because vaccines sometimes contain pork gelatin, China’s shots could be considered forbidden under Islamic law.</p>\r\n<p>…To implement the anti-vax campaign, the Defense Department overrode strong objections from top U.S. diplomats in Southeast Asia at the time, Reuters found. Sources involved in its planning and execution say the Pentagon, which ran the program through the military’s psychological operations center in Tampa, Florida, disregarded the collateral impact that such propaganda may have on innocent Filipinos.</p>\r\n<p>“We weren’t looking at this from a public health perspective,” said a senior military officer involved in the program. “We were looking at how we could drag China through the mud.”</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Frankly, this is sickening. The Pentagon’s anti-vax campaign has undermined U.S. credibility on the global stage and eroded trust in American institutions, and it will complicate future public health efforts. US intelligence agencies <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.cgdev.org/blog/its-time-ban-intelligence-operations-interfering-public-health\">should be banned</a> from interfering with or using public health as a front.</p>\r\n<p>Moreover, there was a better model. It’s often forgotten but the elimination of smallpox from the planet, one of humanities greatest feats, was <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.csis.org/analysis/smallpox-eradication-model-global-cooperation\">a global effort spearheaded by the United States and….the Soviet Union</a>.</p>\r\n<blockquote><p>…even while engaged in a pitched battle for influence across the globe, the Soviet Union and the United States were able to harness their domestic and geopolitical self-interests and their mutual interest in using science and technology to advance human development and produce a remarkable public health achievement.</p></blockquote>\r\n<p>We could have taken a similar approach with China during the COVID pandemic.</p>\r\n<p>More generally, we face global challenges, from pandemics to climate change to artificial intelligence. Addressing these challenges will require strategic international cooperation. This isn’t about idealism; it’s about escaping the prisoner’s dilemma. We can’t let small groups with narrow agendas and parochial visions undermine collaborations essential for our interests and security in an interconnected world.</p>\r\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/06/the-pentagons-anti-vax-campaign.html\">The Pentagon’s Anti-Vax Campaign</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com\">Marginal REVOLUTION</a>.</p>\r\n<img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/899603384/0/marginalrevolution\" />\r\n<div><a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/899603384/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/899603384/marginalrevolution,\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/899603384/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/x.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/899603384/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/899603384/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/06/the-pentagons-anti-vax-campaign.html#comments\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/comments20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/06/the-pentagons-anti-vax-campaign.html/feed\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/commentsrss20.png\" /></a> \r\n<div><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/06/the-pentagons-anti-vax-campaign.html#comments\"><h3>Comments</h3></a><ul><li><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/06/the-pentagons-anti-vax-campaign.html#comment-160769691\">In reply to Hazel Meade.
