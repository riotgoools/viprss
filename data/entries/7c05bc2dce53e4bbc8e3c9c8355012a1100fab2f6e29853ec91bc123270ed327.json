It’s been with us for 3 million years, since before humans were homo sapiens. We have evidence of it in the mummies of ancient Egypt, and it’s mentioned in the Hebrew Bible.</p>\n\n<p>We’ve made extraordinary medical advances. Vaccines, antibiotics, and clean water have saved millions of lives. And yet despite that, in 2022, this disease killed more people than malaria, typhoid, cholera, homicide, and war…combined.</p>\n\n<p>It has gone by many names. In ancient China, it was known as huaifu, meaning “destroyed palace.” In ancient Hebrew, “schachepheth,” meaning wasting away. The 19th-century term: “consumption,” for the way it seemed to consume the body. Today, we call it tuberculosis.</p></blockquote>\n\n <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/disease\">disease</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/John%20Green\">John Green</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/medicine\">medicine</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/science\">science</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/video\">video</a></p>\n\n <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/04/crash-course-lecture-the-deadliest-infectious-disease-of-all-time\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"7c05bc2dce53e4bbc8e3c9c8355012a1100fab2f6e29853ec91bc123270ed327","category":"default"}
