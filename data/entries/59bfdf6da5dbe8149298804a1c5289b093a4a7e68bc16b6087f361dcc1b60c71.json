{"title":"Kottke Comments, Now With Faves","link":"https://kottke.org/24/12/kottke-comments-now-with-faves","date":1734357285000,"content":"\n        <p>Hello, everyone. I just launched a few new features related to the comments here on kottke.org:</p>\n\n<p>1. The ability to fave comments. This feature has been in test mode for the past few months, and I’m happy it’s finally getting a wider release. Only <a href=\"https://kottke.org/members\">kottke.org members</a> can fave for now (but I may open it up for everyone depending on how things go). For now, only you will be able to see what you’ve faved. The number of faves on each comment will be displayed next to the fave button (again, I’m going to see how this works…precise fave counts definitely have their minuses). Non-members will not see fave buttons or fave counts. You can’t fave your own comments — no getting high on your own supply.</p>\n\n<p>There aren’t any limits to the number of comments you can fave, but in the spirit of <a href=\"https://kottke.org/threads/guidelines\">kottke.org’s community guidelines</a>, try to be thoughtful and community-minded about faves…at their best, faves are a useful communal signal for others looking for the most interesting and useful comments.</p>\n\n<p>2. If you’re a member, you can see your own comments and those you’ve faved on your new profile page, which you can find in the menu in the upper right of every page — just click on your name and then “Profile”. (If you’re on mobile, click on the menu, then your name, then “Profile”.) I don’t know if this is the right place for profiles to live, but it’ll do for now. As I add more features to the site, I may have to shift things around a little.</p>\n\n<p>No one else can see your profile page right now, but that might change in the future. At the moment, you won’t be able to see all of your comments and faves, only about ~30 of the most recent — I need to add some pagination here soon.</p>\n\n<p>3. For longer comment threads, I’ve added a sorting option. The default is the threaded view but you can also sort by the most recently posted comments and most popular (i.e. by number of faves). Anyone can use this — it’s going to be super useful for keeping up with new comments on popular threads (like <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/12/whats-the-one-thing-only-you-noticed\">What’s The One Thing Only You Noticed?</a>) and for surfacing the best comments.</p>\n\n<p>Ok, that’s all! I’m pretty excited about finally getting this launched — there’s lots of interesting stuff being shared in the comments these days and helping people find it is a good thing! Let me know in the comments below if you have any questions, feedback, or concerns. And as always, thank you to <a href=\"https://kottke.org/members\">kottke.org’s members</a> for their support in enabling new features like this. ✌️</p>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/kottke.org\">kottke.org</a></p>\n\n         <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/12/kottke-comments-now-with-faves\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"59bfdf6da5dbe8149298804a1c5289b093a4a7e68bc16b6087f361dcc1b60c71","category":"Sites"}
