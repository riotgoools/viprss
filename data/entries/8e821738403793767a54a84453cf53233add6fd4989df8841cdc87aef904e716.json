{"title":"[RODEN] Enrique Allen","link":"https://craigmod.com/roden/097/","date":1732147200000,"content":"Roden Readers —\nThe first memory I have of Enrique Allen is from the campus of Stanford. He had just graduated from the d.school and was teaching part-time. We were about to start working together. He was all bounding lightness. That’s the first image: Jumping, huge bright smile, long black hair, wide open face, totally open heart. Bounding lightness. The lightness stood in contrast to his bigness as a human; not hefty, he was just a tall dude with the broadest of broad shoulders and a lot of muscles.","author":"","siteTitle":"Craig Mod","siteHash":"7358923c3192bccfb6b9f0032f475bef5140f12de0f235c80ca3d98e1a3d393b","entryHash":"8e821738403793767a54a84453cf53233add6fd4989df8841cdc87aef904e716","category":"Sites"}
