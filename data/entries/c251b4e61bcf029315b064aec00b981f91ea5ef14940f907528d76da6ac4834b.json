It's not clear what intelligence in humans is or how it works. We just believe it exists. So then the question is, can machines do the same thing? The truth is no one knows. It could be that human intelligence once we figure out what it is will be as trivial as they tell us the AI \"intelligence\" is. So if you're trying to make sense of it, or if the idea is offensive, try pretending that \"intelligence\" was \"pomegranate\" or \"cauliflower\" -- these are two terms <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JKoFCUaUbY\">John Lennon</a> suggested George Harrison use in place of words in lyrics he hasn't come up with. So say ChatGPT is \"Artificial Cauliflower\" and that should be less offensive, yes? It would make as much sense as calling it intelligence. On the other hand, conversation with my favorite Artificial Cauliflower app does feel pretty much exactly like conversing with a human. A very patient and very knowledgeable but not infallible human.","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"c251b4e61bcf029315b064aec00b981f91ea5ef14940f907528d76da6ac4834b","category":"Sites"}
