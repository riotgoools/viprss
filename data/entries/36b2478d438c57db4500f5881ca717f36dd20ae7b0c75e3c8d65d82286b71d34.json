Known for her active social media presence and bold policy proposals like the Green New Deal, she has garnered significant attention and influence, particularly among younger left-leaning Americans.</li>\r\n<li>Kimberlé Crenshaw: A law professor at UCLA and Columbia University, Crenshaw is a leading scholar of critical race theory and intersectionality. Her work has been influential in shaping contemporary discussions around race, gender, and social justice.</li>\r\n<li>Ibram X. Kendi: A historian and author, Kendi’s works, such as “How to Be an Antiracist” and “Stamped from the Beginning,” have become key texts in the current discourse on race and anti-racism in America.</li>\r\n<li>Robin DiAngelo: An author and academic, DiAngelo’s 2018 book “White Fragility” has become a popular and influential text in discussions about race, privilege, and racism, particularly in the context of whiteness and white allyship.</li>\r\n<li>Mariame Kaba: An activist and organizer, Kaba is a leading voice in the prison abolition movement. Her work focuses on transformative justice, community organizing, and dismantling the prison-industrial complex.</li>\r\n<li>Bhaskar Sunkara: Founder and editor of Jacobin, a leading socialist magazine in the United States, Sunkara has played a significant role in popularizing democratic socialist ideas and policies, particularly among millennials and Gen Z.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Matt and Ezra should be on the list too.  Lina Khan?  Chomsky has a long-running form of influence.  Judith Butler?  Note that AOC seems to have evolved into “another Democratic Party politician.”  EA is no longer in ascendancy, and isn’t strictly “on the Left” either.  Who else?  Those who have pushed for drug legalization and decriminalization?  What do you think?  And the question is about now, not ten years ago.</p>\r\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/03/who-are-currently-the-most-influential-thinkers-intellectuals-on-the-left.html\">Who are currently the most influential thinkers/intellectuals on the Left?</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com\">Marginal REVOLUTION</a>.</p>\r\n<img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/873888269/0/marginalrevolution\" />\r\n<div><a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/873888269/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/873888269/marginalrevolution,\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/873888269/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/x.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/873888269/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/873888269/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/03/who-are-currently-the-most-influential-thinkers-intellectuals-on-the-left.html#comments\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/comments20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/03/who-are-currently-the-most-influential-thinkers-intellectuals-on-the-left.html/feed\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/commentsrss20.png\" /></a> \r\n<div><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/03/who-are-currently-the-most-influential-thinkers-intellectuals-on-the-left.html#comments\"><h3>Comments</h3></a><ul><li><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/03/who-are-currently-the-most-influential-thinkers-intellectuals-on-the-left.html#comment-160731797\">one of “cnn intellectual” don le'moan's most successful ...</a> <i>by Free Bill</i></li><li><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/03/who-are-currently-the-most-influential-thinkers-intellectuals-on-the-left.html#comment-160731792\">In reply to Ricardo.
