There is something gratifying about the technology perfected in the past, allowing me to dream about the future.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>I have enjoyed reading Manuel Moreale for quite a while now. When I saw his email pop up, I was quite delighted. He wanted to include me in his “<a href=\"https://peopleandblogs.com/\" target=\"_blank\">People and Blogs series</a>.” Manuel asks people with blogs to talk about themselves and their websites. He sends out a set of nine standard questions, and it is all done via email. These are well-crafted questions and extract the best out of you. When answering these questions, I had to pause and reflect before answering them. If you are interested in reading about my blogging and writing, <a href=\"https://manuelmoreale.com/pb-om-malik\" target=\"_blank\">here are my answers</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://manuelmoreale.com/pb-om-malik\">People &amp; Blogs/OM</a></p>","author":"Om Malik","siteTitle":"Om Malik","siteHash":"56aa7c22de1a9e5680d03082a2a13db78fe214c96b8119e8d54042cbf2d355ae","entryHash":"8a1e27bca2c7e55bb533f98003bafffa257df2c63af71cfae522ce6f96eb3c7f","category":"default"}
