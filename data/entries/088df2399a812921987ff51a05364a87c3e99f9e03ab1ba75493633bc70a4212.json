We need flowers for the same reason we need poems, or paintings, or songs — because what we can feel will always be infinitely vaster and more complex than what we can name, because words will always break under the weight of the immensities we task them with carrying, will never fully answer the soul’s cry for connection, for consolation, for mercy. </p>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Flowers-Things-Dont-Know-How/dp/1797228943/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/p81.jpg?resize=680%2C848&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"680\" height=\"848\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/p81.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/p81.jpg?resize=320%2C399&amp;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/p81.jpg?resize=600%2C748&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/p81.jpg?resize=240%2C299&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/p81.jpg?resize=768%2C957&amp;ssl=1 768w\" /></a><figcaption><em>Flowers for the loneliest person you know</em></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Artist <a href=\"http://www.tuckernichols.com\" target=\"_blank\">Tucker Nichols</a> was in his late twenties when he found himself in a strange hospital room in a strange city with a strange diagnosis that confounded even his doctors. Nobody knew what to say. Nobody knew how to make it okay. As he fumbled his way to remission, he was saved again and again by the power of human connection, by the many languages of solidarity and sympathy when words fall short. </p>\n<p>Half a lifetime later, as the pandemic swept the globe with its tidal force of terror and uncertainty, Nichols drew on that experience in a tender gesture of sympathy: He began sending small flower paintings to sick people on behalf of their loved ones. (I am thinking of Walt Whitman and his <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2016/04/19/walt-whitman-hospital-visits/\">Civil War hospital visits</a>, writing letters and poems on behalf of wounded and dying soldiers.) He painted for friends, for friends of friends, for strangers. His wife and daughter helped mail the paintings.</p>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Flowers-Things-Dont-Know-How/dp/1797228943/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/p10.jpg?resize=680%2C1003&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"680\" height=\"1003\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/p10.jpg?w=900&amp;ssl=1 900w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/p10.jpg?resize=320%2C472&amp;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/p10.jpg?resize=600%2C885&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/p10.jpg?resize=240%2C354&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/p10.jpg?resize=768%2C1132&amp;ssl=1 768w\" /></a><figcaption><em>Flowers for the nurses who tell you what’s actually happening</em></figcaption></figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Flowers-Things-Dont-Know-How/dp/1797228943/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/p97.jpg?resize=680%2C831&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"680\" height=\"831\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/p97.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/p97.jpg?resize=320%2C391&amp;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/p97.jpg?resize=600%2C734&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/p97.jpg?resize=240%2C293&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/p97.jpg?resize=768%2C939&amp;ssl=1 768w\" /></a><figcaption><em>Flowers for the neighbor who goes on the same early morning walks even though her dog is gone</em></figcaption></figure>\n<p>As word spread of his project, these intimate and specific consolations began to feel unequal to the scale of suffering — we so easily forget that everyone is suffering in one way or another, often invisibly, always ultimately alone — and so he began painting flowers for entire categories of human experience ranging from the depths of despair to those quiet joys that make life livable. </p>\n<p>The result is <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Flowers-Things-Dont-Know-How/dp/1797228943/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>Flowers for Things I Don’t Know How to Say</em></strong></a> (<a href=\"https://search.worldcat.org/title/1417197882\" target=\"_blank\"><em>public library</em></a>) — a floral counterpart to <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2024/04/12/dictionary-of-obscure-sorrows/\"><em>The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows</em></a>, radiating the recognition that no matter how singular what we feel may seem, and how lonely in its singularity, it is just a garden variety feeling, felt by innumerable others since the dawn of feeling, being felt by someone somewhere right now. Out of that recognition unspool the golden threads of connection that bind us to each other and hammock the free-fall of our fear, our uncertainty, our loneliness. </p>\n<figure><a

href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2021/10/22/brain-pickings-becoming-the-marginalian/\">bore the outgrown name <em>Brain Pickings</em></a> for its first fifteen years). It has remained free and ad-free and alive thanks to patronage from readers. I have no staff, no interns, no assistant — a thoroughly one-woman labor of love that is also my life and my livelihood. If this labor makes your own life more livable in any way, please consider lending a helping hand with a <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/donate/\">donation</a>. Your support makes all the difference.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3>newsletter</h3>\n<p><em>The Marginalian</em> has a free weekly newsletter. It comes out on Sundays and offers the week’s most inspiring reading. Here’s <a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/brainpickings/janna-levin-rebecca-elson-anne-lamott-james-gleick\">what to expect</a>.
