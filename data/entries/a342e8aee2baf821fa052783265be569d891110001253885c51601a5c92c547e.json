But if they ever actually stop showing scripting.com, which will always be plain old HTTP, I'll probably ship an Electron product that browse the web, and doesn't care if it's HTTP or whatever new fad Google is promoting these days. I'm going to hold down the fort for the original web, I can't change scripting.com to HTTPS, it would break all the images and probably a lot of other stuff. I fight linkrot, don't bring it on, and fuck Google for thinking they own the freaking web. I use their products, just like I drive a Tesla. Can't help it.","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"a342e8aee2baf821fa052783265be569d891110001253885c51601a5c92c547e","category":"Sites"}
