Dye makers had to ‚Äú<a href=\"https://www.history.com/news/why-is-purple-considered-the-color-of-royalty\">crack open the snail‚Äôs shell, extract a purple-producing mucus and expose it to sunlight for a precise amount of time</a>,‚Äù and it took 250K snails to make an ounce of dye. But did we know purple isn‚Äôt like all the other colors?</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>Most of you here probably know that our perception of color comes down to physics. Light is a type of radiation that our eyes can perceive, and it spans a certain range of the electromagnetic spectrum. Individual colors are like building blocks in white light: they are subdivisions of the visible spectrum. For us to perceive an object as being of a certain color, it needs to absorb some of the subdivisions in the light that falls on it (or all of them, for black). The parts it reflects (doesn‚Äôt absorb) are what gives it its color. But not so for purple, because it is a non-spectral color.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Hahahah. Yessssss.
