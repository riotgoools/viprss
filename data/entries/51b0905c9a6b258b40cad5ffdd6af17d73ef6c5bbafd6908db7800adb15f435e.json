On CNN, one of the worst sanewashing sources for our would-be despot. I can't imagine what happened there. Or maybe I can. Is it possible that the owners of CNN who might have gotten an education and possibly studied a little history from teachers who remembered WW II, and understood that Trump's lines are straight from Mein Kampf, and maybe perhaps possibly maybe with only two weeks to go before the election started envisioning themselves and family on trains to American death camps. After all CNN ran some perceivably negative stuff about Trump, and who knows maybe President Trump won't be so discerning and might just have all media people euthanized. It could happen. Maybe visions of their own mortality caught up with them and they decided to let Blitzer do what he can to douse the flames. Oddly the same thing seems to have happened at the NY Times and the Atlantic, and Trump's former <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/22/us/politics/john-kelly-trump-fitness-character.html\">Chief of Staff</a> has gone on the record now, with audio, explaining what we all know is waiting for us if the US actually goes down the path it appears we quite possibly are going down.","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"51b0905c9a6b258b40cad5ffdd6af17d73ef6c5bbafd6908db7800adb15f435e","category":"Sites"}
