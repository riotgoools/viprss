Four art world insiders said they suspect the painting is held by a private, very rich European family. All parties had an opinion on the core question that drives such a quest: Do collecting families have any responsibility to share iconic works of art with the broader public?</p>\n\n<p>The question has grown more relevant as it becomes clearer that most museums can no longer outbid billionaire collectors for the greatest works of art. Few paintings make that point plainer than Dr. Gachet’s portrait, a piece long on public display that has now vanished into someone’s private home or a climate-controlled warehouse.</p>\n\n<p>For many in the art world, such a work is not just a creative expression, but part of a trade that survives because of the interest and deep pockets of collectors who may, or may not, choose to share their work.</p>\n\n<p>“People are allowed to own things privately,” said Michael Findlay, who was involved as a specialist for Christie’s in the 1990 auction sale of the Gachet. “Does it belong to everybody? No, it does not.”</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>See also a new short documentary on the missing painting:</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/art\">art</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/video\">video</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Vincent%20van%20Gogh\">Vincent van Gogh</a></p>\n\n         <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/12/the-missing-van-gogh-masterpiece\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"c4d577e5339244b28b873ce77dbea4e3b5dc8101bd1b7d44554dd12e4e872e6e","category":"Sites"}
