Certainly all any of us can do is follow our own conscience and retain faith in our democracy. Sometimes it is the very people who cry out the loudest in favor of getting back to what they call “American Virtues” who lack this faith in our country. I believe that our greatest strength lies always in the protection of our smallest minorities.</p>\n\n<p>Sincerely yours,</p>\n\n<p>Charles M. Schulz</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Schulz’s widow Jean Schulz <a href=\"https://schulzmuseum.org/the-circle-continues/\">wrote of the letter</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>The letter turned up recently, and the answer must have startled Mr. Lipton by how appropriate the answer would be if written today.</p>\n\n<p>I always saw Sparky as a great believer in the long flow of history — that the people of the world had seen improvements over the centuries, and that, as he says in his letter, “our greatest strength lies always in the protection of our smallest minorities.”</p></blockquote>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Charles%20Schulz\">Charles Schulz</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Peanuts\">Peanuts</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/USA\">USA</a></p>\n\n         <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/10/charles-schulz-on-being-a-good-citizen\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"75dfe33ac97873843dbdea0ad052092eec17453153a812c5f775e6fd48794d67","category":"Sites"}
