His ability to consistently visualize a subject â€” not how it looked in reality but how it felt to him emotionally â€” led to some of the most famous images of Americaâ€™s natural treasures including Half Dome in Californiaâ€™s Yosemite Valley, the Grand Tetons in Wyoming, and Denali in Alaska, the highest peak in the United States.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>No pre-order links yet, but the stamps will be available on <a href=\"https://about.usps.com/newsroom/national-releases/2024/0223-usps-reveals-more-information-on-stamps-for-2024.htm\">May 15</a>. (via <a href=\"https://www.threads.net/@anseladams/post/C30c7kpp8Lj\">@anseladams</a>)</p>\n\n<p>P.S. I was just poking around the official Ansel Adams site and ran across <a href=\"https://shop.anseladams.com/collections/original-photographs-by-ansel-adams/products/woman-behind-screen-door-independence\">this photo Iâ€™d never seen before of a woman behind a screen door</a>. Really wonderful.</p>\n\n        \n\n <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Ansel%20Adams\">Ansel Adams</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/design\">design</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/photography\">photography</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/stamps\">stamps</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/USPS\">USPS</a></p>\n\n <p>ðŸ’¬ <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/02/usps-to-release-ansel-adams-stamps\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> â†’</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"322c95d019dbf53b785a45a74527cb9435ff7e833fc05b688bbe5c563a94db7b","category":"default"}
