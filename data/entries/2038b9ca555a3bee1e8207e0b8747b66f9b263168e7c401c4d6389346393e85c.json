The video version of the visualization is embedded above.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>A year from now, in 1998, a researcher named Vincent Felitti will <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9635069/\">publish a paper</a> that drastically changes the way we think about these kids â€” and their childhood.</p>\n\n<p>The research will show that these childhood stressors and traumas â€” called Adverse Childhood Experiences â€” have a lifelong effect on our health, relationships, happiness, financial security, and pretty much everything else that we value. It will kickstart decades of research that shows that our childhood experiences shape our adulthood far more than we ever thought.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>This is a good companion to a recent post, <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/04/end-stage-poverty-is-killing-people-in-safety-net-free-america\">End-Stage Poverty Is Killing People in Safety Net-Free America</a>.</p>\n\n <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Alvin%20Chang\">Alvin Chang</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/infoviz\">infoviz</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/The%20Pudding\">The Pudding</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/USA\">USA</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/video\">video</a></p>\n\n <p>ðŸ’¬ <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/04/are-the-kids-alright-when-they-grow-up\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> â†’</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"2038b9ca555a3bee1e8207e0b8747b66f9b263168e7c401c4d6389346393e85c","category":"default"}
