{"title":"Ryan Williams Mindbreaking BMX Free Willy","link":"https://kottke.org/24/03/ryan-williams-mindbreaking-bmx-free-willy","date":1711769834000,"content":"\n        <p>Ryan Williams is an Australian scooter and BMX rider who does wild tricks that make me nervous. In 2013 he perfected a back flip with a nothing front scooter flip, which means he does a backflip while his scooter does a front flip, and then he spent about 10 years trying to get it done on a bike. Travis Pastrana dubbed it the Free Willy. Below is an example of a slightly different trick where he does a front flip instead of a backflip, except this one is easy because he can kind of see where the bike is. Easy. This oneâ€™s the easy one.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>Hereâ€™s a behind the scenes of what it took him to figure out the Free Willy. At 1:40 you can see the first time he does it successfully on a scooter, and about 6:35 is when he gets it on the bike. Incredible stuff.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>Williams won a gold with this trick at the 2023 X Games, obviously.  </p>\n\n <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/bicycles\">bicycles</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/biking\">biking</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/BMX\">BMX</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Ryan%20Williams\">Ryan Williams</a></p>\n\n <p>ðŸ’¬ <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/03/ryan-williams-mindbreaking-bmx-free-willy\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> â†’</p>\n\n    ","author":"Aaron Cohen","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"a6c08d5c90e563a3da05996ff207dd5d4c0c24a3f3fb2ae8d99f20421103e7a4","category":"default"}
