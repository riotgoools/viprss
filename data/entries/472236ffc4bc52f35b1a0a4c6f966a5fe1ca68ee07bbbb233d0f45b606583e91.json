Sinéad was the second female icon to be rendered Bratz-ily; Chappell Roan was <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/C4RWRh9PHJ7/\">the first</a>.)</p>\n\n<p>In an article from earlier this week, Rolling Stone called Roan “<a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/chappell-roan-pop-lgbtq-olivia-rodrigo-1234981099/\">the future of pop</a>.” I love all her musicians, too.</p>\n\n <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Chappell%20Roan\">Chappell Roan</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/music\">music</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Tiny%20Desk%20Concerts\">Tiny Desk Concerts</a></p>\n\n <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/03/chappell-roan\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Edith Zimmerman","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"472236ffc4bc52f35b1a0a4c6f966a5fe1ca68ee07bbbb233d0f45b606583e91","category":"default"}
