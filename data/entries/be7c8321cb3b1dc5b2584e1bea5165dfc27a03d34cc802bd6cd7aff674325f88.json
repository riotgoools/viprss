I’m not even going to waste space debunking the many ways this conspiracy is deeply delusional, but suffice to say that if a media org isn’t running a blockbuster story that would undeniably amass them views and subscribers, it’s because that story doesn’t exist or they can’t confirm it. </p><p>The bigger issue here is that, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/07/14/blueanon-conspiracy-theories-trump-rally-shooting/\">as I wrote for The Washington Post this summer</a>, there is a rampant conspiracism problem in centrist liberal anti-Trump influencer spaces. </p><p>Trump is a threat to democracy and the media does far too much to normalize his dangerous ideology. They regularly launder his image, fail to hold him to the same standards as other politicians, and don’t report on him critically enough. But liberal internet users’ have become increasingly comfortable adopting MAGA tactics and talking points in their efforts to attack him. </p><p>The phenomenon is known as BlueAnon, and in these centrist liberal anti-Trump influencers’ world, shadowy forces, including the mainstream media, are all part of a coordinated plot destroy Kamala Harris’ candidacy and usher Trump back into power.</p><p> Karl Folk, an independent researcher who studies authoritarianism and radicalization, said this “more conspiratorial mind-set has become more pronounced in liberal circles” in recent months. It’s an important reminder to be skeptical and question any unsourced claims built to feed into a preexisting belief system. </p><h2>New conservative grifter just dropped</h2><div><figure><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6af6a778-8e50-4fd8-81a5-bd9fbec68ae4_886x1338.png\"><div><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6af6a778-8e50-4fd8-81a5-bd9fbec68ae4_886x1338.png\" width=\"488\" height=\"736.9571106094808\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6af6a778-8e50-4fd8-81a5-bd9fbec68ae4_886x1338.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6af6a778-8e50-4fd8-81a5-bd9fbec68ae4_886x1338.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6af6a778-8e50-4fd8-81a5-bd9fbec68ae4_886x1338.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6af6a778-8e50-4fd8-81a5-bd9fbec68ae4_886x1338.png 1456w\" loading=\"lazy\" /><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Maia Poet, a 25 year old Israeli-American, recently went viral for claiming that the Hamas attack on October 7th <a href=\"https://x.com/thepeacepoet99/status/1843036649179292098\">made her detransition and abandon the LGBTQ community</a>.
