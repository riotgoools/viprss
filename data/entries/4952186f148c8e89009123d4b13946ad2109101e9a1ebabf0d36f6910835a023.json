As she put it to me in an email (I reached out to make sure I had my facts right), “I like to repurpose cutter quilts, or ones who need a little love, into new, wearable pieces so that we can keep enjoying their beauty, just in a new way!”  </p>\n\n<p>Emory sells her pieces primarily through Instagram, and although I haven’t yet tried to buy one, I love knowing they exist. (<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100081232076754\">Emory Goods</a> is also on Facebook, and will be reappearing on Etsy in the next few weeks.)</p>\n\n        \n\n\n\n <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/02/quilts-turned-into-clothes\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Edith Zimmerman","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"4952186f148c8e89009123d4b13946ad2109101e9a1ebabf0d36f6910835a023","category":"default"}
