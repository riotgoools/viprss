Spotify is way more convenient, but that wasnâ€™t the point. The point was to get out and to feel like youâ€™re hunting, to feel like youâ€™re living your life. Iâ€™m going to the movies, Iâ€™m going to this show. What streaming has done â€” itâ€™s very convenient, but itâ€™s taken the feeling of going hunting and turned it into weâ€™re all just being fed. Weâ€™re all farm animals that are just being fed, and weâ€™re being fed content. You can just stay home. Just stay home. Weâ€™ll just feed it to you. No wonder everyoneâ€™s depressed.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>See also surfing the web vs. *waves hands around at whatever it is weâ€™re soaking in here*.
