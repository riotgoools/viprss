Their fascinating and complex life cycle is unfortunately severely under-researched. What is known is that they take nourishment from the plastic sacs that surround the bagged product, not the product itself, as was previously thought. Notable exceptions to this habit are those living off rubber bands and on analog watch hands.</p>\n\n<p>In most species, they often situate themselves toward the center of the plastic bag, holding in the contents. This leads to speculation that the relationship may be more symbiotic than purely parasitic.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p><img src=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/bread-tag-taxonomy-02.jpg\" srcset=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=500,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/bread-tag-taxonomy-02.jpg 500w, /cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/bread-tag-taxonomy-02.jpg 1200w\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1216\" alt=\"a proposed family tree of plastic bread tags\" /></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/bread-tag-taxonomy-03.jpg\" srcset=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=500,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/bread-tag-taxonomy-03.jpg 500w, /cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/bread-tag-taxonomy-03.jpg 1200w\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"837\" alt=\"a diagram labeling the parts of a plastic bread tag\" /></p>\n\n<p>I admire the commitment to the bit, but HORG appears not to have studied the one actual bit of bread tag taxonomy that could actually be useful: <a href=\"https://www.simplyrecipes.com/colored-tag-bread-meaning-food-editor-8642940\">whether</a> the color of the bread tag <a href=\"https://www.foodandwine.com/what-the-color-of-your-bread-tag-really-means-8379446\">indicates when the bread was baked</a>.
