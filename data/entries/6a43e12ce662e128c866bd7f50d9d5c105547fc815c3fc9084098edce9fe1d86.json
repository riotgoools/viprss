I once thought I could make server products or toolkits for people I called \"poets\" -- motivated writers. I have given up on that, at least for the time-being. I think a properly motivated intelligent writer could get developer-like results, I've seen it happen (Brent Simmons, Dan MacTough). They make really good developers because they understand the user perspective so well, it still lives inside them. The problem seems to be motivation, and a poet knowing that they need to be super-motivated and have the time, to get <i>anything</i> technical to work. If they knew what was required, my 2024 theory goes, and had studied for it, the way they studied for their degree (assuming they have one), they could not only be successful, but they could contribute to the developer process. Analogously, we all have to learn a little cooking just to get through life, but only a few people are chefs. <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2024/01/07/012112.html\">Julia Child</a>, a hero of mine, believed she could teach anyone to be a good-enough cook. But I bet she was frustrated by human reality. <span>ðŸ˜„</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"6a43e12ce662e128c866bd7f50d9d5c105547fc815c3fc9084098edce9fe1d86","category":"default"}
