Use React! Use this library and save yourself some typing!”\n</p><p><strong>\nBut no!\nNot yet!\nDo it the hard way.\nSolve everything yourself with plain JavaScript.\n</strong>\nIt’s the best way to learn.\n</p><h3>\nWhat next?\n</h3><p>\nIf you had a web app in mind, start building it now.\n(OK, you can use shortcuts.)\n</p><p>\nIf you had an iPhone or Android app in mind, learn <a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/react-native/\">React Native</a>.\n</p><p>\nIf you want a good-paying job, you can <a href=\"https://sive.rs/gethired\">get hired</a> almost anywhere.\nSince you know the real JavaScript foundations more than most people, you’re very valuable.\nYou can quickly learn whatever framework they’re using.\n</p><h3>\nAny other suggestions?\nWhat worked for you?\n</h3><p>\nPlease share any other suggestions or experiences, here:\n</p>\n<img src=\"/images/js.png\" />","author":"Derek Sivers","siteTitle":"Derek Sivers","siteHash":"4098504c0d0759e13901f29e63f7d7dbb1d972a078c6dc4560660f373da5c25e","entryHash":"9589ca08437790f817a2ff5acafa005d893eb40eeceaef3c97ab895380ef7094","category":"default"}
