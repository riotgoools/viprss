My phone tells me that I am connected at roughly 10 Mbps. I am having a WhatsApp conversation with family members while receiving some email updates. The book I was reading on my iPhone is synced with my iPad.</p>\n\n\n\n<span></span>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"785\" src=\"https://149366103.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/img_0392-1-1024x785.jpg\" srcset=\"https://149366103.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/img_0392-1-1024x785.jpg 1024w, https://149366103.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/img_0392-1-300x230.jpg 300w, https://149366103.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/img_0392-1-768x589.jpg 768w, https://149366103.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/img_0392-1-192x147.jpg 192w, https://149366103.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/img_0392-1-1100x843.jpg 1100w, https://149366103.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/img_0392-1-560x429.jpg 560w, https://149366103.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/img_0392-1.jpg 1271w\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The Apple Tags in my baggage continuously update me on the location of my bags. And when I remove my AirPods Max, the music stops automatically. The concept of spatial sound and beamforming microphones for an enhanced headphone experience wasnâ€™t something I could have imagined when I bought my first Bose headphones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are the little things we now take for granted, but had you told me about them 20 years ago, it would have seemed like pure magic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I remember those days when you would land and be overwhelmed with incoming messages and emails because you were not connected. I was also on the press junket when we first experienced the Internet in the air! It was not as fast, and not as reliable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What are other examples of technology we take for granted today that would have seemed magical in the past?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>New Delhi.
