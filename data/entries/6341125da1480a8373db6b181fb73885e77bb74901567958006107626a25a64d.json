Last fall, Aja Frost wrote <a href=\"https://platonicloveletter.substack.com/p/addicted-to-exercise\">I Was (Am?) Addicted to Exercise</a> for the newsletter Platonic Love: </p>\n\n<blockquote><p>I never deviated from or relaxed my exercise routine; it was sacred. As long as I exercised, my body wouldnâ€™t slip back into its old state. Iâ€™d be safe.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>And last week, Rod Gilchrist wrote <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/may/05/running-addict-knee-replacements-fitness\">I Was a Running Addict</a> for The Guardian: </p>\n\n<blockquote><p>The trouble is, once youâ€™ve got the running bug, itâ€™s hard to scale back, even when your body demands it.</p></blockquote> \n\n<p>And a few days after that, The Guardian also ran <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/article/2024/may/08/a-moment-that-changed-me-fitness-was-my-superpower-then-a-ball-and-chain\">I Thought Fitness Was My Superpower. Then I Realized It Was a Ball and Chain</a>, by Sam Pyrah: </p>\n\n<blockquote><p>I tried to push through it â€“ until, suddenly, neither my body nor my brain could find a reason to carry on. I slowed to a walk. I stopped my watch. I sat down and had a little cry, the sweat drying on my back. Then I walked home.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>The essays remind me of a concept called Positive Addiction (and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060912499/ref=nosim/0sil8\">a 1985 book of the same name</a>) â€” the idea that itâ€™s possible to be truly addicted to things that are good for you. Iâ€™m an almost-daily runner, and I do understand how it could be described as addiction, although for now I just love it. Maybe a key is that I donâ€™t run especially long distances. And itâ€™s a relatively new habit. But I guess thereâ€™s (hopefully) still plenty of time for it to sour. </p>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/exercise\">exercise</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/health\">health</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/personal%20essays\">personal essays</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/running\">running</a></p>\n\n         <p>ðŸ’¬ <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/05/addicted-to-exercise\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> â†’</p>\n\n    ","author":"Edith Zimmerman","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"6341125da1480a8373db6b181fb73885e77bb74901567958006107626a25a64d","category":"default"}
