It is in the gap of absence that we learn trust, in the gap between knowledge and mystery that we discover wonder. Every act of making space is in some sense a creative act and an act of faith. And yet in its open-endedness and indeterminacy, in its courtship of uncertainty, it challenges our most basic instincts about how to govern our lives, unsettling the foundation of our illusion of control (which is always the opposite of faith). </p>\n<p>Italian writer <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2019/03/20/crescendo-quintavalle-sanna/\">Paola Quintavalle</a> and artist Miguel Tanco offer a lovely antidote to our unease about this essential creative and contemplative act in <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Making-Space-Paola-Quintavalle/dp/1592704085/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>Making Space</em></strong></a> (<a href=\"https://search.worldcat.org/title/1420447483\" target=\"_blank\"><em>public library</em></a>) — a charming illustrated taxonomy of the many forms of this existential exhale, the many ways we can deepen and magnify life by giving things beyond our control the time and space they take.</p>\n<p>There is making space “to plant a seed and watch it grow,” space “for taking a chance” and “for another try,” space “for a hand to hold and when it’s time, for letting go.”</p>\n<p><a

who are no longer here.” A boy with a party hat and a mouthful of cake encircled by angry peers in party hats becomes an emblem of “the truth stuck inside your mouth.” A constellation of little cosmonauts make space “to wonder why.” </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Making-Space-Paola-Quintavalle/dp/1592704085/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\"
