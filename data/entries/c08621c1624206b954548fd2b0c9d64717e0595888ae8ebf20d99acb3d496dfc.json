Many people, faced with fighting insurance companies, simply give up: One study found that Americans file formal appeals on only 0.1% of claims denied by insurers under the Affordable Care Act.</p><p>Insurers have wide discretion in crafting what is covered by their policies, beyond some basic services mandated by federal and state law. They often deny claims for services that they deem not 'medically necessary'\" despite a doctor's orders. </p><p>When it comes to denying healthcare coverage, UnitedHealth <a href=\"https://x.com/kenklippenstein/status/1864346481647390791\">stands above its competitors</a>.
