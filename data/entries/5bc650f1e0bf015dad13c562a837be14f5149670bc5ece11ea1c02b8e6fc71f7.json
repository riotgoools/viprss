It's how I add elements to the RSS feed for my blog and for apps I develop. The latest is <a href=\"http://source.scripting.com/#1716308936000\">source:self</a> whose value is the canonical URL for the feed. This was a useful addition from Atom, which was <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/reallysimple/blob/main/worknotes.md#61522-by-dw----v049\">supported</a> by <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/reallysimple/blob/main/README.md\">reallySimple</a> in 2022, and I wanted to include the value without having to add another namespace to my feed. It has been implemented in the reallySimple package too, so the data will be available to FeedLand, and any other software that uses it. Small move forward for interop.","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"5bc650f1e0bf015dad13c562a837be14f5149670bc5ece11ea1c02b8e6fc71f7","category":"default"}
