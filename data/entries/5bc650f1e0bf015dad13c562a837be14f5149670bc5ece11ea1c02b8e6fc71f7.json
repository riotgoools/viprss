The latest is <a href=\"http://source.scripting.com/#1716308936000\">source:self</a> whose value is the canonical URL for the feed. This was a useful addition in Atom, which I <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/reallysimple/blob/main/worknotes.md#61522-by-dw----v049\">supported</a> in <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/reallysimple/blob/main/README.md\">reallySimple</a> in 2022, and I wanted to include the value without having to add another namespace to my feed and feeds produced by my products, so reallySimple now supports both.
