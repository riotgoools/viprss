There was a guy wearing a brand new Trump hat. I've never seen that in a public place. Otherwise he looked perfectly normal. I wondered what kind of weirdo has that kind of hate in his heart. Is he listening to what Trump is saying these days? I didn't want to ask him. These are our Nazis. They've hated us their whole lives. Until now, I never knew they existed. And now they get to parade around in public with these obscene hats on. When will the swastikas start appearing on the hats. I wonder if this is the first of many. Like the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOeFhSzoTuc&amp;t=24s\">Germans</a> partying at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick%27s_Caf%C3%A9_Casablanca\">Rick's place</a> in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casablanca_(film)\">Casablanca</a>. One more thing. Have you heard about the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_War_(2024_film)\">Civil War</a> movie coming out later this year. Watch the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDyQxtg0V2w\">trailer</a>. Maybe wait till morning, because you might have trouble sleeping.","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"2bc9c2a9d81991873095921ba7d8d296f05fb24ef18ba99c208d156070564b1d","category":"default"}
