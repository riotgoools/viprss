The material forms dark ridges and peaks of gas and dust surrounding the cluster, lit on the inner side, while layers of diffuse, translucent clouds blanket over them. Around and within the gas, a huge number of distant galaxies can be seen, some quite large, as well as a few stars nearer to us which are very large and bright.\" /></p>\n\n<p>Wow, check out <a href=\"https://esawebb.org/images/weic2425a/\">this just-released image from the JWST team of star cluster NGC 602</a>.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>The local environment of this cluster is a close analogue of what existed in the early Universe, with very low abundances of elements heavier than hydrogen and helium. The existence of dark clouds of dense dust and the fact that the cluster is rich in ionised gas also suggest the presence of ongoing star formation processes. This cluster provides a valuable opportunity to examine star formation scenarios under dramatically different conditions from those in the solar neighbourhood.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>It is very worth your time to <a href=\"https://esawebb.org/images/weic2425a/\">click through</a> and look at this image in all of its massive celestial glory. I found this image <a href=\"https://badastronomy.beehiiv.com/p/mind-vaporizing-image-from-jwst-may-show-first-ever-brown-dwarfs-seen-in-another-galaxy\">via Phil Plait</a>, who calls it “one of the most jaw-droppingly mind stomping images I’ve seen from JWST” and, directing us back to the science (remember the science?!), notes that NGC 602 is actively forming stars (it’s only about 5 million years old) and that it depicts “the first young brown dwarfs outside our Milky Way”. Cool!</p>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/astronomy\">astronomy</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/James%20Webb%20Space%20Telescope\">James Webb Space Telescope</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Phil%20Plait\">Phil Plait</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/photography\">photography</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/science\">science</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/space\">space</a></p>\n\n         <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/10/gobsmacking-image-of-a-stellar-nursery\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"4e88fb1546650262eac576e8fd8f08a880077a26a4a85512b220f08c7708bf6a","category":"Sites"}
