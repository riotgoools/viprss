(I’ve owned five automobiles in my life, all of them cheap, one of which smoked and required the driver’s side door to be kept shut with a bungee cord hooked to the opposite armrest, stretched across both driver and passenger. What can I say? I was a young cartoonist on a cartoonist’s budget.)</p>\n\n<p>Unlike those budget vehicles, however, the new deluxe Penguin Random House anniversary edition of Cars and Trucks and Things That Go is lavishly well-made, attentively reprinted with sharp black lines and warm, rich, watercolors. It includes an especially lively afterword by Scarry’s son Huck, in which he explains, using language even a kid can understand, how his dad wrote and drew the book, as well as hinting at what it was like to grow up as the son of arguably the world’s most popular and successful children’s book author.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Reader, I have never clicked “buy” faster than I did when <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0593706307/ref=nosim/0sil8\">ordering the 50th anniversary version of Cars and Trucks and Things That Go</a> — I’m very much looking forward to peeking behind the scenes. But also, do read <a href=\"https://yalereview.org/article/chris-ware-richard-scarry\">Ware’s whole piece</a>…it’s an inspiring review of Scarry’s career &amp; impact and contains all manner of little observations like these:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>(Lowly was perhaps the first children’s book animal character with a real nod to the ADA and the myth of “dis”-ability, and cheerfully makes his linear form work in all sorts of inspiring and disarmingly moving ways.)</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>And:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>But the more one looks at his work, the more one sees how the European daily grocery trip, the walk to a nearby shop or tradesman’s guild, the tiny apple car fit for a worm are not part of the blowout-all-in-for-oneself-oil-fueled-free-for-all toward which America was barreling in the late 1960s.</p></blockquote>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/art\">art</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/books\">books</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Cars%20and%20Trucks%20and%20Things%20That%20Go\">Cars and Trucks and Things That Go</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/cartoons\">cartoons</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Chris%20Ware\">Chris Ware</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Richard%20Scarry\">Richard Scarry</a></p>\n\n         <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/10/chris-ware-on-richard-scarry\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"e8771670423f86e3492c431f3a1186befaf0719ffedd13e063133e2cb9f228fd","category":"Sites"}
