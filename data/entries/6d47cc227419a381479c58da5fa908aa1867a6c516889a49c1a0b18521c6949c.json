He hasn't done anything to tell us who he is in that dimension. To the extent that we do know anything about him: 1. He's a jokester. 2. He has a brilliant and beautiful wife. 3. He has a huge villa in Italy which he keeps very private. That's about it. He's rich. We have nothing in common. He should run for office and get in the mix. The fact that the NYT chose him, that says something about them, other than they don't care what people think, or they think we're really shallow and will fall for bullshit like George Clooney who says he loves Biden. Why should Clooney have more of a say in this than I do? Tell me what Nancy Pelosi thinks, or Al Sharpton (I know I said that before). Or give Michael Moore a shot. He has a lot more skin in the game than Clooney. I'd love to read an op-ed by David Frum. Liz Cheney! I would trust her opinion on this.","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"6d47cc227419a381479c58da5fa908aa1867a6c516889a49c1a0b18521c6949c","category":"default"}
