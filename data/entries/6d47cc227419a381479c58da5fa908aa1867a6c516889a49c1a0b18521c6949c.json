He hasn't done anything to tell us who he is in that dimension. To the extent that we do know anything about him: 1. He's a <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/george-clooney-reveals-hilarious-pranks-hes-pulled-while-pretending-to-be-brad-pitt-and-bill-clinton-063025071.html\">prankster</a>. 2. He has a brilliant and beautiful <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amal_Clooney\">wife</a>. 3. He has a huge <a href=\"https://www.housebeautiful.com/lifestyle/entertainment/a45302334/george-clooney-not-selling-lake-como-villa/\">mansion</a> in Italy which he keeps very private. 4. He's <a href=\"https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/a44752794/george-clooney-net-worth/\">rich</a>. We have nothing in common. He should run for office and get in the mix. The fact that the NYT chose him, that says something about them, they don't care what people think, or they think we're really shallow and will fall for bullshit like George Clooney. He loves Biden. We didn't even know he knew Joe Biden! Why should Clooney have more of a say in this than I do? Tell me what <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi\">Nancy Pelosi</a> thinks, or Al Sharpton. Or give <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Moore\">Michael Moore</a> a shot. He has a lot more skin in the game than Clooney. I'd love to read an op-ed by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Frum\">David Frum</a>. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liz_Cheney\">Liz Cheney</a>. <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22elie+mystal%22\">Elie Mystal</a>.","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"6d47cc227419a381479c58da5fa908aa1867a6c516889a49c1a0b18521c6949c","category":"default"}
