Screen shot to the right. It shows that the art was very much still being practiced then. It looks cared-for. All themes designed by Bryan Bell. I am going to set up a demo of the home page, because I want to look at it as \"live\" as I can get it, and see if there are ideas there I want to bring forward to 2024.","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"8cef419b6264ebb90499097fb473f9ad144c0b6ee9b77d840758212c64fcc70e","category":"default"}
