{"title":"A Time of Earnestness","link":"https://kottke.org/24/11/a-time-of-earnestness","date":1731001765000,"content":"\n        <p></p>\n\n<p>Laura Olin’s newsletter of “art, internet, and ideas” is a favorite of mine (<a href=\"https://buttondown.com/lauraolin\">subscribe here</a>), and I appreciated <a href=\"https://buttondown.com/lauraolin/archive/189-ain-even-been-planted-yet/\">her comments from this morning</a> on why sci-fi and fantasy movies work for moments like these.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>I’ve never thought of myself as a person who’s particularly into sci fi or fantasy. But on the worst days — and yesterday was one — I find myself thinking of the essential lessons of art in that genre. Maybe because a lot of it is about people in dire situations making stark moral choices for a larger good — and for various reasons World War II parables aren’t really going to do it anymore, at least in America. We saw <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_One\">Rogue One</a> in the theater soon after Trump’s first election and I took some strength from the image of (vague spoilers) Felicity and Diego on the beach, sacrificing themselves to give everything thereafter a chance. I’ve been thinking of the Battlestar Galactica reboot of the W. Bush years, with the fighter pilots touching a portrait of a comrade on a fallen planet on their way out to battle; of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQMDmb3mOY8\">Stellan Skarsgard’s speech</a> and “one way out” in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKOegEuCcfw\">Andor</a>, which you must watch; of Katniss touching three fingers to her lips in a salute special to her community, and a crowd of people she can’t even see saluting back; of the fundamental text that is “Why must we go on?” / “Because there’s some good in this world, Mr. Frodo, and it’s worth fighting for.” Is all this cringe? Undoubtedly; but I think we’ve entered a time that requires deep earnestness. (I hope to come back to this paragraph in four years and feel I was being overly dramatic about how bad things might get but I suspect I will not.)</p></blockquote>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Laura%20Olin\">Laura Olin</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Lord%20of%20the%20Rings\">Lord of the Rings</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/movies\">movies</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Star%20Wars\">Star Wars</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/video\">video</a></p>\n\n         <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/11/a-time-of-earnestness\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"8a860c55439431ee14da6ff1ca62fcb05d263ec9fbbc60934661a199d7a76881","category":"Sites"}
