I can follow anyone on any server. </p>\n<p>I think it's the timeline? And the ability to delete posts. Keeping all that in sync is a lot of work, and presumably a lot of traffic? </p>\n<p>Also replies. If I reply to a post when viewing it on another server, the reply should show up under any other view of that post.</p>\n<p>What else??</p>\n<p>PS: Only thinking about features that are used by Mastodon to federate, not potential future features. If that were the rule, then RSS could do anything AP could do, right -- because you can always add the feature. So, just the features that are in use.</p>\n<p>PPS: I posted this <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@davew/112213481032208332\">on Mastodon</a> and may post it elsewhere, if I do I'll link them in here. </p>","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"ee2d8fdfd84e39f77d8805f1a4543544d1bf4419ef01c5407a57b4f3b5abf4af","category":"default"}
