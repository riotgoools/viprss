But home is not a place — it is a locus of longing, always haunted by our existential homelessness. “Welcome home!” a cheaply suited broker once exclaimed at me, swinging open the door to a tiny studio as my foot fell on the beige wall-to-wall carpet and my eyes on the two dead roaches embracing in the corner. Between the time I left my family home in Bulgaria in my late teens and the time I settled in Brooklyn in my late twenties, I moved in and out of housing across continents and oceans, cycling through dozens of dwellings. No matter how many books I shelved and how many plants I potted, none ever felt like a home. That took another decade — not because of anything in the house, but because I had finally begun feeling at home in myself. </p>\n<p>Other animals don’t anguish with such existential troubles. “They are so placid and self-contain’d,” Whitman wrote. “They do not sweat and whine about their condition. They do not lie awake in the dark and weep for their sins… Not one is dissatisfied, not one is demented with the mania of owning things.” From the moment they are born until the moment they die, other animals are entirely at home in their being, for they don’t suffer the tyranny of a self, with all its restless need for expression and actualization. The homes they build — strange and various, baffling and beautiful in their singularity — reflect that purity of being. No ego and no self-image govern the design — only the exquisite genius of evolution, refining the blueprint over eons to make each home a perfect temple for consecrating each creature’s biological destiny. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Home-Isabelle-Simler/dp/0802856209/r?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/simler_home23.jpg?resize=680%2C478&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"680\" height=\"478\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/simler_home23.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/simler_home23.jpg?resize=320%2C225&amp;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/simler_home23.jpg?resize=600%2C422&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/simler_home23.jpg?resize=240%2C169&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/simler_home23.jpg?resize=768%2C540&amp;ssl=1 768w\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Home-Isabelle-Simler/dp/0802856209/r?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/simler_home_bowerbird.jpg?resize=600%2C982&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"600\" height=\"982\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/simler_home_bowerbird.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/simler_home_bowerbird.jpg?resize=320%2C524&amp;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/simler_home_bowerbird.jpg?resize=240%2C393&amp;ssl=1 240w\" /></a></p>\n<p>The wonder, perfection, and diversity of animal dwellings come alive in artist Isabelle Simler’s book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Home-Isabelle-Simler/dp/0802856209/r?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>Home</em></strong></a> (<a href=\"https://search.worldcat.org/title/1390811890\" target=\"_blank\"><em>public library</em></a>) — a vibrant catalogue of nature’s creativity: <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2023/10/29/bowerbird/\">the miraculous courtship cathedral</a> of the satin bowerbird (<em>Ptilonorhynchus violaceus</em>), the “lace citadel” of the cross orbweaver spider (<em>Araneus diadematus</em>), the “silky apartment” of the comet moth (<em>Argema mittrei</em>), the “mossy miniature home” of the hummingbird (<em>Trochilidae</em>), the “cactus cabin” of the world’s smallest owl, the elf owl (<em>Micrathene whitneyi</em>), smaller than a sparrow. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Home-Isabelle-Simler/dp/0802856209/r?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/simler_home_owl.jpg?resize=600%2C773&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"600\" height=\"773\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/simler_home_owl.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/simler_home_owl.jpg?resize=320%2C412&amp;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/simler_home_owl.jpg?resize=240%2C309&amp;ssl=1 240w\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Home-Isabelle-Simler/dp/0802856209/r?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/simler_home_ovenbird.jpg?resize=600%2C782&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"600\" height=\"782\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/simler_home_ovenbird.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/simler_home_ovenbird.jpg?resize=320%2C417&amp;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/simler_home_ovenbird.jpg?resize=240%2C313&amp;ssl=1 240w\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Home-Isabelle-Simler/dp/0802856209/r?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/simler_home_termite.jpg?resize=600%2C984&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"600\" height=\"984\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/simler_home_termite.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/simler_home_termite.jpg?resize=320%2C525&amp;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/simler_home_termite.jpg?resize=240%2C394&amp;ssl=1 240w\" /></a></p>\n<p>There is <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2023/08/27/notes-on-complexity-neil-theise/\">emergence incarnate</a> in the termite cathedral, built by millions of blind insects with no leader and no blueprint.
