If you went inland from the coast for a few miles there was nothing left. No trees, only a few skeletal all-concrete buildings where the beach used to be, otherwise <a href=\"https://flickr.com/photos/scriptingnews/73989089/in/album-1588659\">everything destroyed</a>. What you don't necessarily realize that it isn't just 15 feet of water, it's 15 feet of stormy ocean with cars and building debris being pushed around floating in the water.
