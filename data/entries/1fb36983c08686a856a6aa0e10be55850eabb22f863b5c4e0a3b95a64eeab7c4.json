The roof is especially clever.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>He introduced a curved double roof that created an air gap between the first and second roof. As the heat naturally rises and escapes into the gap, the prevailing winds quickly carry it away, accelerating this process and cooling the building more efficiently.</p>\n\n<p>But thatâ€™s not all. The first roof is made up of perforated ceiling slabs, allowing the heat to escape more efficiently and therefore to be quickly transported by the wind.</p>\n\n<p>The other genius idea was to also curve the roof, which allowed for the Venturi effect â€” a phenomenon where air speeds up as it moves through the narrower sections created by the curve and therefore boosting natural ventilation.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>(via <a href=\"https://thekidshouldseethis.com/post/diebedo-francis-kere-gando-school\">the kid should see this</a>)</p>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/architecture\">architecture</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Burkina%20Faso\">Burkina Faso</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Diebedo%20Francis%20Kere\">Diebedo Francis Kere</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/energy\">energy</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/physics\">physics</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Sara%20Saadouni\">Sara Saadouni</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/science\">science</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/video\">video</a></p>\n\n         <p>ðŸ’¬ <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/11/the-clever-design-that-keeps-this-school-cool-in-scorching-heat\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> â†’</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"1fb36983c08686a856a6aa0e10be55850eabb22f863b5c4e0a3b95a64eeab7c4","category":"Sites"}
