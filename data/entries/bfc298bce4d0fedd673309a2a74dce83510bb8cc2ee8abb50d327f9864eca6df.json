Mothers in Healing is just one of a slew of pages that have uploaded dozens of videos claiming the many benefits of living in North Korea before hard-selling Reus Research's NAD+ supplements. The pages argue that dominant narratives about North Korea are wrong, that the U.S. government is brainwashing its citizens, and that North Korea is actually an amazing place to live.</p><p>It's unclear who is behind these pages, but digital marketers said that the videos are likely engagement bait, where users create outlandish or obscure videos in order to to generate views, which inevitably leads to sales of the products they're promoting in TikTok Shop. </p><p>All of the pages posting the North Korean propaganda feature AI-generated avatars and images and link to the NAD+ supplements in TikTok Shop. According to Reus Research's profile on TikTok Shop, the company has sold over 110,400 units of its NAD+ supplements through the app for between $39.99 and $89.99. The company did not respond to a request for comment.  </p><div><figure><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F23a98c9a-f017-4d70-a580-0625487c10da_2732x2048.jpeg\"><div><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F23a98c9a-f017-4d70-a580-0625487c10da_2732x2048.jpeg\" width=\"1456\" height=\"1091\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F23a98c9a-f017-4d70-a580-0625487c10da_2732x2048.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F23a98c9a-f017-4d70-a580-0625487c10da_2732x2048.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F23a98c9a-f017-4d70-a580-0625487c10da_2732x2048.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F23a98c9a-f017-4d70-a580-0625487c10da_2732x2048.jpeg 1456w\" loading=\"lazy\" /><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>\"People are just doing whatever they can to stop the scroll, and in this case, it's making the most ridiculous video and story that they can to get people to stop and watch and buy [the supplements],\" said Greg Baroth, a digital marketing consultant in Los Angeles. </p><p>At least one account was previously posting similar content about people moving to Norway and Japan and discovering the \"anti aging\" supplements there, before pivoting to North Korea, which seems to play better with the algorithm.</p><div><figure><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ab2099b-41a6-4476-a0fd-fce5a1ea3383_1076x394.png\"><div><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ab2099b-41a6-4476-a0fd-fce5a1ea3383_1076x394.png\" width=\"462\" height=\"169.17100371747213\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ab2099b-41a6-4476-a0fd-fce5a1ea3383_1076x394.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ab2099b-41a6-4476-a0fd-fce5a1ea3383_1076x394.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ab2099b-41a6-4476-a0fd-fce5a1ea3383_1076x394.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ab2099b-41a6-4476-a0fd-fce5a1ea3383_1076x394.png 1456w\" loading=\"lazy\" /><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>\"What started as a simple trip to North Korea unexpectedly changed the entire meaning of my life,\" another user promoting the supplements posted. \"By learning about their culture and seeing how they REALLY live, I realized that the THOUGHT of returning to the U.S. no longer appealed to me.\"</p><p>Martyn Williams, a researcher focused on North Korea at the Stimson Center, a Washington D.C. think tank, explained on <a href=\"https://x.com/martyn_williams/status/1839318808328286642\">X</a> that in addition to the stories being implausible, North Korea does not simply allow foreigners to permanently relocate to the country.

Second of all, the airport is close. Third of all, the last time I evacuated for a hurricane, I went to my mom's house in Northport for Hurricane Ian,” she said on Instagram. </p><p>The experience left her traumatized, she said, because her mother’s whole street ended up flooding leaving them without power or running water. “I don't want to evacuate to my mom's house because the last time I did that, it was the worst time ever!” she said. So, she’s planning to ride out the storm in her apartment with her cat and a “bathtub full of backup water.” </p><p>Naturally, Caroline is already using the impending danger to promote her book. </p><p>“I’m not evacuating for the hurricane. I live in Sarasota, on the beach, in evacuation zone A,” she <a href=\"https://x.com/carolinecaloway/status/1843831586313445758\">tweeted</a> on Tuesday. “For more great advice, buy my second book! It’s called Elizabeth Wurtzel and Caroline Calloway’s Guide to Life. It’s about to come out if I survive! It’s an advice book ;-) Cute!!!!! &lt;3” </p><p>As with everything Caroline does, it’s unclear how much of this is performance art and how much she’s risking her own life.

Blogging is kind of lost, and I would like to see that change. Every time you post something you're proud of on a social media site, how about taking a moment and posting it to your blog too. And while there, if appropriate, link to something from some part of your post, even though the social media sites don't support linking, the web is still there and it still does.”</p></blockquote><p><a href=\"https://www.usermag.co/subscribe?\"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><h2>Social media is not causing the youth mental health crisis</h2><p>The myth that social media is causing the mental health crisis among young people simply will not die. I <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DA5Jk-3xF0e/\">went on the BBC</a> last night to dispel some of this moral panic in relation to the latest <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/08/tech/tiktok-sued-14-states-childrens-mental-health/index.html\">absurd state lawsuits</a> against TikTok, and I highly recommend watching <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNxV4UMRYQA\">the first part of my YouTube series</a> about the history of moral panics around kids and social media. </p><p>danah boyd is a top researcher who’s been studying kids’ social media use and the mental health effects for literal decades. She wrote an entire book on the topic and was a founding board member for Crisis Text Line. She just published <a href=\"https://zephoria.substack.com/p/risks-vs-harms-youth-and-social-media\">an excellent piece digging into this hysteria around kids and tech</a>. I thought these lines were especially notable:</p><blockquote><p>One thing that intrigues me, is that many of those who propagate hate are especially interested in blocking children from technology for fear that allowing their children to be exposed to difference might make them more tolerant. (No, gender is not contagious, but developing a recognition that gender is socially and politically constructed — and fighting for a more just world — sure is.) There’s a long history of religious communities trying to isolate youth from kids of other faiths to maintain control.</p><p>There’s no doubt that media — including social media — exposes children to a much broader and more diverse world. <strong>Anyone who sees themselves as empowering their children to create a more just and equitable world should want to conscientiously help their children see and understand the complexity of the world we live in.</strong></p></blockquote><div><figure><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5713749-1014-48aa-ac30-5947d07fbe78_1407x19.png\"><div><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5713749-1014-48aa-ac30-5947d07fbe78_1407x19.png\" width=\"1407\" height=\"19\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5713749-1014-48aa-ac30-5947d07fbe78_1407x19.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5713749-1014-48aa-ac30-5947d07fbe78_1407x19.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5713749-1014-48aa-ac30-5947d07fbe78_1407x19.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5713749-1014-48aa-ac30-5947d07fbe78_1407x19.png 1456w\" loading=\"lazy\" /><div></div></div></a></figure></div><div><figure><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F454456cf-780a-4d20-a7d5-7be454670d2d_1780x910.png\"><div><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F454456cf-780a-4d20-a7d5-7be454670d2d_1780x910.png\" width=\"520\" height=\"265.7142857142857\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F454456cf-780a-4d20-a7d5-7be454670d2d_1780x910.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F454456cf-780a-4d20-a7d5-7be454670d2d_1780x910.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F454456cf-780a-4d20-a7d5-7be454670d2d_1780x910.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F454456cf-780a-4d20-a7d5-7be454670d2d_1780x910.png 1456w\" loading=\"lazy\" /><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p><em><a href=\"https://www.garbageday.email/\">Garbage Day</a></em>, the award-winning internet culture newsletter written by Ryan Broderick, is throwing a big event for the election this month.
