{"title":"party time","link":"https://ellesho.me/page/website/now/#party-time","date":1726084800000,"content":"<p>i was inspired to integrate cursor party on my <a href=\"https://ellesho.me/page\" target=\"_blank\">homepage</a> after reading matt webb's blog post, <a href=\"https://interconnected.org/home/2024/09/05/cursor-party\" target=\"_blank\">\"every webpage deserves to be a place.\"</a> i had been interested in <a href=\"https://www.partykit.io\" target=\"_blank\">partykit</a> for a while, after seeing things like <a href=\"https://spencer.place\" target=\"_blank\">spencer chang</a>'s <a href=\"https://playhtml.fun\" target=\"_blank\">playhtml</a>. all of it just makes sense for the kind of place i want my homepage to be – a fun place for visitors and a place for me to experiment.</p>\n          <p>cursor party basically makes a webpage \"multiplayer.\" you see other people's cursors floating around the page as they navigate it. it even allows you to chat with these other guests. it's a really lovely idea for individual webpages which can feel isolated from the social web. in a lot of ways, the chat is how i wish \"social\" websites were – just about talking to people, not about signaling for engagement numbers or amassing followers for clout.</p>\n          <p>of course, just cloning a repo and calling it a day is no fun. my head immediately filled with ideas to add to it. here are some features i added to make it my own:</p>\n          <ul>\n              <li>color picker to let guests customize their look (initial load is a random color)</li>\n              <li>instead of cursors, guests appear as little pixel sprites that face the direction of the cursor movement so there's some visual feedback to show someone is paying attention to you</li>\n              <li>made a rudimentary username system using ethereum extension connect (frame, rainbow, metamask, etc.) so, if you don't want to chat anon, you can display as a verified id via onchain ens or <a href=\"https://support.ens.domains/en/articles/8834820-offchain-gasless-dnssec-names-in-ens\" target=\"_blank\">offchain dns name</a> (my favorite part!!) as i've mentioned previously with the indieweb stuff, i love the idea of websites being your online id and i think dnssec ens names are a nice way to do that. it's only two steps: 1. add a txt to your dns records 2. set the dns name as your primary name in the <a href=\"https://app.ens.domains\" target=\"_blank\">ens dapp</a>. that's all! now when you connect, it will show that name. i will be using my <a href=\"https://app.ens.domains/elle.email\" target=\"_blank\">elle.email</a> dns name so you can verify it's really me in chat ^-^</li>\n          </ul>\n          <p>so that's where my week went. it was a lot of trial and error learning about working with partykit and the cursor party code and also ens stuff. getting the dns names to resolve with the different signer extensions was a bit tricky (⌒_⌒;) i was having a stressful week irl with parent getting sick and preventing me from sleeping much anyways soooo (╥_╥) but i think i got things working and now you can chat with strangers on the internet here! (make sure you are in day mode. chat is disabled in night mode of course.)</p>\n          <p>to chat, just press forward slash (/) and start typing. your sprite will come into focus for the other guests.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"elle's homepage","siteHash":"dd208d4e2120a26882546f1ff773220630fa4cf22a80af7c01f94b10c97a05f1","entryHash":"ac4833e4a8e0f383a4ba63f97ed4e20633228e1e41ea451a613379c26262ac43","category":"Sites"}
