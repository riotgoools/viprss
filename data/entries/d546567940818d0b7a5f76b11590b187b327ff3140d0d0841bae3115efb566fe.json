Brunson, DiVincenzo, Hart, Anunoby and Hartenstein. They have totally distinct superpowers. Tonight's game will be played without Brunson and Anunoby, both injured. That means McBride and Atchiuwa start, probably. I kept wanting to tell friends about these guys, they're just as exciting as the starters. And don't forget there's another <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jericho_Sims\">center</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alec_Burks\">forward</a> still on the bench who have done real starting minutes this year and two years ago. They are Knicks too.","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"d546567940818d0b7a5f76b11590b187b327ff3140d0d0841bae3115efb566fe","category":"default"}
