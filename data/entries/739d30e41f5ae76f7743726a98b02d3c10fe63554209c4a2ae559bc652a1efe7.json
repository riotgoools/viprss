Despite differences in their topographies and regulatory environments, we find several common dynamics. As these MSAs grow, we see that fewer new net units are built at the periphery and a smaller share of the new units are built as single-family detached houses. As a greater share of new net units are built in infill locations, more units are built using higher-density—and more costly—multifamily housing construction techniques. Interestingly, we see these housing supply patterns in both “pro-growth” MSAs and “highly regulated” MSAs. Among all of our sample MSAs, we also find a declining share of Census tracts that participate in accommodating growth. Our results are consistent with the existence of a convex housing supply curve. We believe that this secular trend will pose genuine challenges to many urban housing policies aimed at improving affordability.</p></blockquote>\r\n<p>That is from <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1540-6229.12490\" target=\"_blank\">a newly published paper</a> by Anthony W.
