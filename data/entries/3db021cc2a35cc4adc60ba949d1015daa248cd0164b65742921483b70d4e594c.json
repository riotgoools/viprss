Here's my list: Kurt Vonnegut, My uncle Ken (not his writing, rather his way of telling stories), my father, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Baker\">Russell Baker</a>, Robert Hunter (lyricist for the Dead), <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Coupland\">Douglas Coupland</a> (specifically <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microserfs\">MicroSerfs</a>), the Suck.com guys, everyone who was writing at Hotwired in 1995. I'll think of others, but those are the ones who come to mind. I have been a constant reader since I was a little kid, so there's a mix of writing styles from authors I don't immediately remember. I should also do one of these lists for who inspired my software.","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"3db021cc2a35cc4adc60ba949d1015daa248cd0164b65742921483b70d4e594c","category":"default"}
