The reason was the switch to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight_saving_time\">Daylight Savings Time</a>. This happens every year. The fix is to edit stats.json in the mail sender app's folder, and change <code>whenLastUpdate</code> to the day before, save it, and restart the sender app. It immediately sends out the correct email. I put this note here so I might find it next time it happens and I forget how to fix it. <span>ðŸ˜„</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"3194ebed9e9fe1e6f3fb35d459436e91e7544dd071497507d45ad332def6e927","category":"default"}
