What constitutes responsible parenting? Did their parents do something dangerous, or was it a brilliant parenting move that taught lifelong lessons? What they recall is a life-changing adventure made possible by a free-spirited mother who believed they could do it.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/04/learning/film-club-pony-boys.html?unlocked_article_code=1.UE4.tDoR.gQIU5HLGBxFe\">You can watch Pony Boys here</a> and <a href=\"https://ponyboys.net/\">check out more about their journey here</a>, including press clippings, letters the boys &amp; their parents received, and photos.
