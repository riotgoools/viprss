{"title":"The Last Years of Alexei Navalny, In His Own Words","link":"https://kottke.org/24/10/the-last-years-of-alexei-navalny-in-his-own-words","date":1728915919000,"content":"\n        <p><a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2024/10/21/alexei-navalny-patriot-memoir\">The New Yorker has some excerpts of Alexei Navalny’s diary from the last 2 years of his life</a>, taken from his forthcoming memoir, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0593320964/ref=nosim/0sil8\">Patriot</a>.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>2022, January 17th.</p>\n\n<p>Exactly one year ago today I came home, to Russia.</p>\n\n<p>I didn’t manage to take a single step on the soil of my country as a free man: I was arrested even before border control.</p>\n\n<p>The hero of one of my favorite books, “Resurrection,” by Leo Tolstoy, says, “Yes, the only suitable place for an honest man in Russia at the present time is prison.”</p>\n\n<p>It sounds fine, but it was wrong then, and it’s even more wrong now.</p>\n\n<p>There are a lot of honest people in Russia-tens of millions. There are far more than is commonly believed.</p>\n\n<p>The authorities, however, who were repugnant then and are even more so now, are afraid not of honest people but of those who are not afraid of them. Or let me be more precise: those who may be afraid but overcome their fear.</p>\n\n<p>There are a lot of them, too. We meet them all the time, in all sorts of places, from rallies to the media, people who remain independent. Indeed, even here, on Instagram. I recently read that the Ministry of the Interior was firing staff who had “liked” my posts. So in Russia, in 2022, even a “like” can take courage.</p>\n\n<p>In every period, the essence of politics has been that a tin-pot tsar who wants to arrogate to himself the right to personal, unaccountable power needs to intimidate the honest people who are not afraid of him. And they, in turn, need to convince everyone around them that they should not be afraid, that there are, by an order of magnitude, more honest people than the mean little tsar’s security guards. Why live your whole life in fear, even being robbed in the process, if everything can be arranged differently and more justly?</p>\n\n<p>The pendulum swings endlessly. Or the tug-of-war. Today you are brave. Tomorrow they seem to have scared you a bit. And the day after tomorrow they have scared you so much that you despair and become brave again.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Two years later, Navalny was dead, murdered by Russia’s leader, dictator Vladimir Putin. I do not think it is hyperbole to read Navalny’s words as a warning, a harbinger of what happens to a country and its people come under undemocratic leadership.</p>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Alexei%20Navalny\">Alexei Navalny</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/books\">books</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/crime\">crime</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/murder\">murder</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Patriot\">Patriot</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/politics\">politics</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Russia\">Russia</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Vladimir%20Putin\">Vladimir Putin</a></p>\n\n         <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/10/the-last-years-of-alexei-navalny-in-his-own-words\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"4f475f96a33b58946a65c2b12a0b2a0e35053c1664c757d44a5903fa06e461e3","category":"Sites"}
