I have different gardening rituals for every aspect of my creative work and business systems. these rituals are like containers that help me be on autopilot mode — it helps me silence the indecisions and noise in my head so that I can be even more deeply in the creative flow. </p><p><br /></p><h1>sprints is riding energy waves</h1><p>the sprint way of working is to focus intensely on a creative project deadline for a clearly defined, consecutive container of time. most of my sprints are between 1-3 days. </p><p><strong>sprints are different from rituals in that they</strong></p><ul><li><p>have a clear creative output  </p></li><li><p>have a deadline</p></li><li><p>need advance planning, ie:  </p><ul><li><p>need energy reserves + energetic/creative attunement </p></li><li><p>need an incubation period before</p></li><li><p>have energetic limitations in how often you can do it </p></li></ul></li><li><p>need a hibernation / rest period after<br /></p></li></ul><p>this is why I think about sprints as <strong>riding a <em>wave</em> of creative energy and momentum, building up and accumulating towards a clear creative output</strong>. it’s like a plant producing a flower/fruit, or a creature giving birth. there is intense adrenaline and birth energy in sprinting — it forces a kind of hyper-focus that is totally unsustainable for long periods of time. sprints force you to ruthlessly prioritize. you don’t have time to linger in the details and indecisions — because you have a constant awareness of a deadline. thus, the result is something both deliberately planned <em>and</em> — free and spontaneous. </p><p></p><h1>containers of comfort vs. intensity </h1><p>if the point of a ritual is that you can return to it <em>anytime</em>, as often as daily, or multiple times a day — in that it’s a garden container that provides a sense of earthy comfort — then sprints are like the equivalent of having wild, brief love affairs with your creative work. they are special. they require energy, planning, deliberation, anticipation, and post-processing. and of course: <em>always a looming sense of the ending / death process. </em></p><p><strong>you are married to your rituals, but your sprints are your most passionate love affairs.</strong> </p><p>and of course, because I always think about non-duality — in this metaphor, <strong>any project or practice could be both a ritual <em>or</em> a sprint.</strong> you can nurture a 1 hour long, daily writing practice, AND/OR spend a weekend staying up until 4am, feverishly completing a first draft. </p><p></p><h1>non-duality, interdependence &amp; hybridity </h1><p>sprints cannot exist without rituals — because without the ongoing practices of presence and tending, you won’t be able to gather the momentum and energy to channel into a specific output. </p><p><em>how</em> you gather this energy and show up in your ritual is totally up to you — perhaps your ritual includes research, rest, doodling, dreaming, sketching, talking, or decomposting things. everything you do in rituals become raw material for your sprints. </p><p>often times I’ve found that my rituals themselves become and feel like <strong>hybrid or micro-sprints</strong> — whenever I write long ideas posts, make a podcast episode, or send a newsletter, I’m channeling focused energy into a 2-3 block period of time. I enter my day with a clear output in mind, a deadline, and an attunement to my energy. I can show up to do this daily, or weekly, or whenever I feel the momentum build up. <br /></p><h1>the cyclical process <br /></h1><p>I’ll leave you with a short distilled summary: </p><p>rituals and sprints are both essential containers for creative energy. </p><p>rituals nourish you, and give you the safety and foundation to be free, expressive, and spend your creative energy in focused output. </p><p>your sprints — and what you make from them — then feed back into your rituals, and infuse them with new inspiration, insight, and direction. </p><p>then, slowly, over time, some of your rituals will feel like sprints, and your sprints will feel like rituals. you’ll learn to dance fluidly in between — earth and water, fire and air. 🍃</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n<hr />\n\n\n  <p><strong>see also:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://keningzhu.com/journal/the-three-rhythms-of-the-creative-process\" target=\"_blank\">the three rhythms of the creative process</a><br /><a href=\"https://keningzhu.com/journal/daily-rituals-for-the-psychic-creative-immune-system\">daily rituals for the psychic-creative immune system</a><br /><a href=\"https://keningzhu.com/journal/business-as-honoring-creative-energy\" target=\"_blank\">honoring your creative energy in business<br /></a><a href=\"https://keningzhu.com/journal/feeling-safe-in-creative-work-business\" target=\"_blank\">feeling safe in creative work &amp; business </a></p><p><em>💌 I write a weekly newsletter on creative alchemy called </em><a href=\"https://keningonline.squarespace.com/letters\" target=\"_blank\"><em>guide.notes</em></a><em>.
