But otherwise it is not true. Can you reconstruct analytically why the economist might have held this view?</p>\r\n<p>The economist’s view hinges on the relationship between a government’s fiscal position and the determination of the price level, as articulated by the <strong>Fiscal Theory of the Price Level (FTPL)</strong>. The FTPL posits that the price level is determined by the government’s fiscal policy—specifically, the present value of its future primary surpluses relative to its outstanding debt—rather than solely by monetary factors such as the money supply.</p>\r\n<p>Here’s an analytical reconstruction of why the economist might have held the view that the FTPL becomes more true as governments approach insolvency:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Government’s Intertemporal Budget Constraint (GIBC):</strong>The GIBC states that the current real value of government debt (<span><span>BB</span><span><span><span>B</span></span></span></span>) must equal the present value of future primary surpluses (<span><span>PV(S)PV(S)</span><span><span><span>P</span><span>V</span><span>(</span><span>S</span><span>)</span></span></span></span>):<span><span><span>B=PV(S)B = PV(S)</span><span><span><span>B</span><span>=</span></span><span><span>P</span><span>V</span><span>(</span><span>S</span><span>)</span></span></span></span></span>This equation implies that the government must eventually generate enough primary surpluses (budget surpluses excluding interest payments) to repay its debt.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Normal Circumstances—Solvent Government:</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>When a government is solvent, it has the capacity to adjust its fiscal policy—by increasing taxes or reducing spending—to ensure that <span><span>PV(S)PV(S)</span><span><span><span>P</span><span>V</span><span>(</span><span>S</span><span>)</span></span></span></span> matches <span><span>BB</span><span><span><span>B</span></span></span></span>.</li>\r\n<li>In this scenario, the central bank’s monetary policy is the primary determinant of the price level. The government doesn’t need the price level to adjust to satisfy its budget constraint because it can adjust fiscal variables.</li>\r\n<li>The Quantity Theory of Money (QTM) or other monetary theories are more relevant here, linking the money supply and velocity of money to the price level.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Approaching Insolvency—Fiscal Limitations:</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>As a government approaches insolvency, its ability to generate sufficient future primary surpluses diminishes. It may face political, economic, or structural barriers to raising taxes or cutting spending.</li>\r\n<li>In this case, the GIBC cannot be satisfied through adjustments in fiscal policy alone.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Price Level Adjustment Necessity:</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>To satisfy the GIBC when <span><span>PV(S)PV(S)</span><span><span><span>P</span><span>V</span><span>(</span><span>S</span><span>)</span></span></span></span> is insufficient, the only remaining variable that can adjust is the price level (<span><span>PP</span><span><span><span>P</span></span></span></span>).</li>\r\n<li>An increase in the price level reduces the real value of nominal government debt (<span><span>BB</span><span><span><span>B</span></span></span></span>), effectively lowering the debt burden.</li>\r\n<li>This inflationary adjustment allows the GIBC to hold despite the government’s inability to generate adequate primary surpluses.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Dominance of Fiscal Policy in Price Determination:</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>When the government is near insolvency, fiscal considerations become paramount in determining the price level.</li>\r\n<li>Monetary policy may become subordinate or even impotent because the central bank might be compelled to accommodate the government’s fiscal needs (e.g., by monetizing debt).</li>\r\n<li>The FTPL becomes the relevant theory, as it explains how fiscal imbalances necessitate price level adjustments to satisfy the GIBC.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Conclusion—Conditional Validity of the FTPL:</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Under normal, solvent conditions, the FTPL does not primarily determine the price level because the government can adjust fiscal policy, and monetary policy remains effective.</li>\r\n<li>As insolvency looms, fiscal constraints force reliance on price level adjustments, making the FTPL increasingly accurate in explaining inflation dynamics.</li>\r\n<li>Therefore, the economist argues that the FTPL becomes “more true” as a government approaches insolvency because fiscal limitations leave the price level as the main adjustment mechanism to restore fiscal balance.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>\r\n<p>The economist believed that the FTPL’s applicability depends on the government’s fiscal health. In solvency, fiscal adjustments can maintain balance without affecting the price level, keeping monetary policy as the main determinant of inflation. Near insolvency, fiscal adjustments are constrained, necessitating price level changes to satisfy the government’s budget constraint—thus, the FTPL becomes more accurate in explaining the price level under these conditions.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>\r\n<p>Because when a government is solvent, it can adjust taxes and spending to ensure its debts are covered, so fiscal policy doesn’t determine the price level—the central bank’s monetary policy does. But as a government nears insolvency and can’t generate enough future surpluses to repay debt, the only way to satisfy its budget constraint is through a higher price level (inflation reducing the real value of debt). So the fiscal theory of the price level becomes more applicable—the price level adjusts to ensure the real value of government debt equals the present value of future surpluses. Thus, the economist believed the fiscal theory is “more true” as governments approach insolvency because fiscal limitations force the price level to adjust to restore fiscal balance.</p>\r\n<p><strong>TC again</strong>: Here is<a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://chatgpt.com/share/66fdc8e2-21b0-8010-bec1-716d5688c74a\" target=\"_blank\"> the link to the chat</a>.  What percent of professional economists would have come up with a better answer?  Here is <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03169-9\" target=\"_blank\">an article on the o1 model beating the experts</a>.</p>\r\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/10/ask-chatgpt-o1-preview-fiscal-theory-of-the-price-level-edition.html\">Ask ChatGPT o1-preview, fiscal theory of the price level edition</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com\">Marginal REVOLUTION</a>.</p>\r\n<img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/905643440/0/marginalrevolution\" />\r\n<div><a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/905643440/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/905643440/marginalrevolution,\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/905643440/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/x.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/905643440/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/905643440/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/10/ask-chatgpt-o1-preview-fiscal-theory-of-the-price-level-edition.html#comments\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/comments20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/10/ask-chatgpt-o1-preview-fiscal-theory-of-the-price-level-edition.html/feed\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/commentsrss20.png\" /></a> \r\n<div><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/10/ask-chatgpt-o1-preview-fiscal-theory-of-the-price-level-edition.html#comments\"><h3>Comments</h3></a><ul><li><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/10/ask-chatgpt-o1-preview-fiscal-theory-of-the-price-level-edition.html#comment-160819289\">In reply to Bob.
