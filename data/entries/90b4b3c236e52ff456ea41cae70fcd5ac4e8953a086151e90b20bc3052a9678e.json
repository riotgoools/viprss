Shortly after <a href=\"https://www.manton.org/\">Manton</a> funded <a href=\"https://micro.blog/\">Micro.blog</a> on Kickstarter, I became a member. I’ve come and gone from the platform, but have always loved what they were doing. I love the idea of a microblog, especially when we’re all learning the lesson (how many times now?) about how important it is to self-publish on your own domain. Yes, I participate in social media. Still. I was one of the first several hundred people on Twitter. But I’m increasingly publishing on my own domains, caring less about who sees it and how many people like it and more about having a digital version of myself that lives beyond my physical form. Those of us who have been around the web since the beginning have seen networks and platforms come and go. And when they go, so goes our content… or was it their content?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway, all of that is to say, I have <a href=\"https://micro.bradbarrish.com/\">a microblog</a> again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BTW, the title of this post is an homage to my long-time friend, <a href=\"https://ghuneim.com/\">Mark Ghuneim</a>‘s motto “dispute the text.”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1170\" height=\"2967\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/bradbarrish.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/img_8088.jpeg?resize=1170%2C2967&amp;ssl=1\" /></figure>","author":"bradbarrish","siteTitle":"Brad Barrish","siteHash":"91e49f51884b2947fac16e947ba7e59fe5a24800befb4760d388da1b057f4f23","entryHash":"90b4b3c236e52ff456ea41cae70fcd5ac4e8953a086151e90b20bc3052a9678e","category":"default"}
