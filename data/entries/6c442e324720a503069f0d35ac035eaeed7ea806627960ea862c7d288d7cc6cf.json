{"title":"Here’s how to live: Pursue pain.","link":"https://sive.rs/htl10","date":1639094400000,"content":"<p>\nEverything good comes from some kind of pain.\n<br />\nMuscle fatigue makes you healthy and strong.\n<br />\nThe pain of practice leads to mastery.\n<br />\nDifficult conversations save your relationships.\n</p><p>\nBut if you avoid pain, you avoid improvement.\n<br />\nAvoid embarrassment, and you avoid success.\n<br />\nAvoid risk, and you avoid reward.\n</p><p>\nAnyone can be their best when things are going well.\n<br />\nBut when things go wrong, you see who they really are.\n<br />\nRemember the classic story arc of the hero’s journey.\n<br />\nThe crisis — the most painful moment — defines the hero.\n</p><p>\nImprovement is transformation.\n<br />\nIt brings the pain of loss of the comfortable previous self.\n<br />\nIt brings the pain of a new set of problems.\n<br />\nWealth brings the pain of responsibility.\n<br />\nFame brings the pain of expectations.\n<br />\nLove brings the pain of attachment.\n<br />\nIf you avoid pain, you avoid what you really want.\n</p><p>\nThe goal of life is not comfort.\n<br />\nPursuing comfort is both pathetic and bad for you.\n<br />\nComfort makes you weak and unprepared.\n<br />\nIf you overprotect yourself from pain, then every little challenge will feel unbearably difficult.\n</p><p>\nPeople say they’re not doing the work because it’s hard.\n<br />\nBut it’s hard because they’re not doing the work.\n</p><p>\nComfort is a silent killer.\n<br />\nComfort is quicksand.\n<br />\nThe softer the chair, the harder it is to get out of it.\n</p><p>\nThe right thing to do is never comfortable.\n<br />\nHow you face pain determines who you are.\n</p><p>\nTherefore, the way to live is to steer towards the pain.\n<br />\nUse it as your compass.\n<br />\nAlways take the harder option.\n<br />\nAlways push into discomfort.\n<br />\nIgnore your instincts.\n</p><p>\nPain’s power relies on surprise.\n<br />\nIf you expect it, it’s weaker.\n<br />\nIf you choose it, it’s gone.\n</p><p>\nChoosing pain makes it bearable.\n<br />\nIt loses its power to hurt you.\n<br />\nYou become its master, not victim.\n</p><p>\nPain is coming anyway.\n<br />\nDon’t get a shield.\n<br />\nGet a saddle.\n<br />\nTame it.\n</p><p>\nDon’t wish for good luck.\n<br />\nGood luck makes you complacent.\n<br />\nPractice thriving with bad luck.\n<br />\nBad luck makes you resourceful and strong.\n<br />\nNo matter what the world throws your way, you can stand worse.\n</p><p>\nChoosing pain means pushing past your instincts.\n<br />\nFood that tastes good is bad for you, and vice-versa.\n<br />\nSo don’t use your feelings as a guide.\n</p><p>\nChoose pain in small doses to build your resistance to it.\n</p><p>\nA daily ritual of hard exercise gives a great perspective on life’s other pains.\n</p><p>\nPut yourself into stressful situations.\n<br />\nEventually, almost nothing will seem stressful.\n</p><p>\nSocially, try to get rejected.\n<br />\nLearn about “rejection therapy”.\n<br />\nMake audacious requests that you think will be denied.\n<br />\nThis removes the pain of rejection.\n<br />\nAnd you’ll be surprised how often they say yes.\n</p><p>\nThe best way to learn a foreign language is to stop speaking your mother tongue.\n<br />\nNo matter how embarrassing or frustrating, communicate only in your new language.\n<br />\nNecessity is the best teacher.\n<br />\nBut it hurts.\n</p><p>\nPractice taking on the various kinds of pain.\n<br />\nAttempt something that seems impossible — something that terrifies you.\n<br />\nGive a speech.\n<br />\nDo a ten-day silent meditation.\n<br />\nQuit a habit.\n<br />\nApologize to someone you wronged.\n</p><p>\nDon’t congratulate yourself if your attempt avoids failure.\n<br />\nRemember: you want the pain.\n<br />\nThe sooner you pay a price, the less it costs.\n</p><p>\nBe absolutely honest with everyone.\n<br />\nStop lying, completely.\n<br />\nYou lie when you’re afraid.\n<br />\nYou lie to avoid consequences.\n<br />\nAlways say the truth.\n<br />\nTake the painful consequences.\n</p><p>\nYou weren’t meant to be idle.\n<br />\nYou weren’t built for sitting and staring at screens.\n<br />\nYou live to push, pull, climb, and grow.\n</p><p>\nThe most exhilarating experiences in your life so far were daring.\n<br />\nYour proudest moments were overcoming a struggle.\n<br />\nThe best happiness comes after some pain.\n</p><p>\nThe best waves on the beach can knock you over.\n<br />\nThat’s the best kind of play.\n</p><p>\nSince you can’t avoid problems, just find good problems.\n<br />\nHappiness isn’t everlasting tranquility.\n<br />\nHappiness is solving good problems.\n</p><p>\nThat’s why we play games.\n<br />\nGames are challenges.\n<br />\nAny challenge can be turned into a game.\n</p><p>\nThe English word “passion” comes from the Latin word “pati”, meaning “to suffer or endure”.\n<br />\nTo be passionate about something is to be willing to suffer for it — to endure the pain it’ll bring.\n</p><p>\nBut don’t be a masochist.\n<br />\nBe a scholar of pain.\n<br />\nEvery pain has a lesson inside, and a reason why it hurts.\n<br />\nAnalyze it.\n<br />\nUnderstand it.\n</p><p>\nGhosts don’t leave until you’ve understood their message.\n<br />\nProblems persist until you claim them and solve them.\n<br />\nFace them directly and they’ll disappear.\n</p><p>\nFirst we figured out how to fly, then how to get to the moon.\n<br />\nAfter you conquer the little problems, you’ll face the better ones.\n</p><p>\nFacing pain helps you relate to others.\n<br />\nYour problems are never unique.\n<br />\nWhatever problems you’ve had, many other people have had the same problem.\n<br />\nWe empathize with someone who’s struggling.\n<br />\nIt opens our hearts more than seeing someone win.\n</p><p>\nMost people don’t get to choose how they suffer.\n<br />\nOnce you tame pain for yourself, tame it for others.\n</p><p>\nThe easy road leads to a hard future.\n<br />\nThe hard road leads to an easy future.\n<br />\nSteering towards the pain is how to live.\n</p>","author":"Derek Sivers","siteTitle":"Derek
