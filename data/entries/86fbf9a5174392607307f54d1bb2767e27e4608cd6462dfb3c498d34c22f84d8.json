{"title":"How Photos Were Transmitted by Wire in the 1930s","link":"https://kottke.org/24/03/how-photos-were-transmitted-by-wire-in-the-1930s","date":1710263970000,"content":"\n        <p></p>\n\n<p>I didnâ€™t know what to expect from this 1937 video explanation of how wire photos were transmitted to newspapers, but a double stunt sequence featuring an airplane and a death-defying photographer was not anywhere on my bingo card. This starts kinda slow but it picks up once they get into the completely fascinating explanation of how they sent photographs across the country using ordinary telephone lines. The whole setup was portable and they just hacked into a wire on a telephone pole, asked the operator to clear the line, and sent a photo scan via an analog modem.
