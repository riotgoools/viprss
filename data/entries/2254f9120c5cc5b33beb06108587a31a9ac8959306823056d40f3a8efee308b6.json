I asked ChatGPT to write a poem using ideas from a random song written by John Lennon. It chose Imagine. I asked that it write a poem using the ideas in Day Tripper. And finally I asked it to write a song based on the story of The Matrix.","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"2254f9120c5cc5b33beb06108587a31a9ac8959306823056d40f3a8efee308b6","category":"default"}
