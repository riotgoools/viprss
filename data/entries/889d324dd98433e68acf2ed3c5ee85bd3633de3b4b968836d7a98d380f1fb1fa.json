The influencers and posters are the denizens — jellyfish, filter feeders, sharks, octopuses, rays, squid, clownfish, and so on. The lurkers are the visitors, marveling at the shape and color of the aquarium’s denizens.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Lopatto was spurred to post because she feels that Threads is too much gift shop:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>Threads is also unbalanced as an ecosystem, skewed toward Brands, a particularly noxious infraclass of influencer that is nonetheless profitable for the network. But for Threads to be valuable to Brands — more valuable than, say, TikTok — there needs to be a strong base of lurkers. Most lurkers will tolerate Brands, but Brands themselves aren’t a draw. They’re just the gift shop at the aquarium.</p></blockquote>\n\n        \n\n <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Elizabeth%20Lopatto\">Elizabeth Lopatto</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Threads\">Threads</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Twitter\">Twitter</a></p>\n\n <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/02/social-media-sites-are-metaphorical-aquariums\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"889d324dd98433e68acf2ed3c5ee85bd3633de3b4b968836d7a98d380f1fb1fa","category":"default"}
