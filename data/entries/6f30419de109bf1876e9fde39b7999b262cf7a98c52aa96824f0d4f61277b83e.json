Doc and I used to <a href=\"https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/04/16/followsthegrain.png\">talk</a> about how something \"follows the grain of the web.\" Twitter has its own grain, formed by its character limit, what information is shared (ie number of followers in both directions). </p>\n<p>I made a list of some of the social networks I've been on starting in the mid-70s. The list is very long. And each of them had their own limits, rules and features, and each led to a certain kinds of relationships between the participants. Mail lists that gain traction always flame out. It's hard to get people to read your blog. If you make it easier it changes into something else. Instagram, Youtube, TikTok form hierarchies of influencers. I think of thos as the networks Taylor Lorenz covers. </p>\n<p>But there isn't a structure that I'm aware of that leads to people working together. It's a puzzle I keep trying to figure out. </p>\n<p>We need \"working together\" to survive climate change and fascism. It would be good to crack this nut. </p>\n<p>One of the nicest things about ChatGPT is that it's always up for working with together with you. The critics of AI don't begin to understand this. As an example, I'm going to ask ChatGPT to draw a picture of people working together. <a href=\"https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/04/16/peopleWorkingTogether.png\">Here it is</a>.</p>\n<p>What got me thinking this way this morning is a bit of collaboration I did <a href=\"https://www.threads.net/@palafo/post/C5zHWbPOJun\">with palafo</a> on Threads. It's remarkable. We actually did some work together. It may be hard to read the thread but if you're curious about collaborative systems, here's a real example. Serendipitous, unplanned, but we figured something out by combining our experiences. Fantastic.</p>\n<p>Later, Ben Werdmuller, a person who I've gotten to know a little recently, is intelligent and asks good questions. He asked one <a href=\"https://www.threads.net/@ben.werdmuller/post/C50vyIruTCB\">today</a>, how do they get the live audience on SNL to laugh when they want them to laugh. I had an idea and <a href=\"https://www.threads.net/@davew/post/C50wy5NsYD0\">shared</a> it. </p>\n<p>If you take away one thing from this post it's that we can collaborate with the machines, and maybe that will unlock collaboration between humans. In fact, in a way they are facilitating the collaboration. If you want to be part of the collective human intelligence, you may be thinking about the machines in the wrong way. Maybe they're the most human thing we have, because AI is made up of humans, like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4UPDUpjkHg0\">Soylent Green</a>. <span>ðŸ˜„</span></p>\n<p>PS: I asked ChatGPT to draw a picture of <a href=\"https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/04/16/cleaningAMess.png\">humans working together</a> to clean up a mess. </p>","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"6f30419de109bf1876e9fde39b7999b262cf7a98c52aa96824f0d4f61277b83e","category":"default"}
