He's a freaking MAGA. So he's got to gradually increase the pressure on Israel, but he has to be mindful that there already is a shitload of pressure all around, which is the last thing we need, more pressure. A lot more people will die if it spirals out of control. But he is increasing the pressure. The images of the air food drops into Gaza from US planes is exactly the right way to proceed for the US. It shows that there's another path, compassion and help. </p>\n<p>Being president of the United States is a complicated thing IOW. </p>\n<p>Jeff, I know you know this, btw. But that would be the adult discussion, which we never have. Journos seem to think Americans can't understand it, but somehow we understand the arcane rules and history of the NBA, NFL and MLB. The functioning of politics isn't really any more complicated. </p>","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"3368825c948613ffe4f44074515547925f79cb9136a7f1b45bd1f4a62e324224","category":"default"}
