{"title":"Hopefulness Is the Warrior Emotion","link":"https://kottke.org/24/08/hopefulness-is-the-warrior-emotion","date":1723822523000,"content":"\n        <p></p>\n\n<p>The musician <a href=\"https://www.nickcave.com/\">Nick Cave</a> was on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert earlier this week (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8qmV6MYCF4\">full interview</a>) and he read <a href=\"https://www.theredhandfiles.com/do-you-still-believe-in-us/\">a letter from his Red Hand Files</a>, an AMA project where fans write in with questions and he answers them. The question was:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>Following the last few years I’m feeling empty and more cynical than ever. I’m losing faith in other people, and I’m scared to pass these feelings to my little son. Do you still believe in Us (human beings)?</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.theredhandfiles.com/do-you-still-believe-in-us/\">a lovely letter in response</a> (which he reads in the video above), Cave writes that “much of my early life was spent holding the world and the people in it in contempt” and that “it took a devastation to understand the idea of mortal value, and it took a devastation to find hope”. That devastation was the death of his 15-year-old son in 2015, which he talks more about <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXPIBFfA2Ho\">in this interview</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1250872464/ref=nosim/0sil8\">in this book</a>. Cave’s response concludes:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>Unlike cynicism, hopefulness is hard-earned, makes demands upon us, and can often feel like the most indefensible and lonely place on Earth. Hopefulness is not a neutral position either. It is adversarial. It is the warrior emotion that can lay waste to cynicism. Each redemptive or loving act, as small as you like, Valerio, such as reading to your little boy, or showing him a thing you love, or singing him a song, or putting on his shoes, keeps the devil down in the hole. It says the world and its inhabitants have value and are worth defending. It says the world is worth believing in. In time, we come to find that it is so.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>I promise, your day will be better if you take a few minutes to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFM4GVl-WqI\">watch</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theredhandfiles.com/do-you-still-believe-in-us/\">read</a> this letter. And <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8qmV6MYCF4\">the entire interview</a> is worth watching as well — there is no better interviewer on the topic of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB46h1koicQ\">loss and grief</a> than Stephen Colbert.</p>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/interviews\">interviews</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Nick%20Cave\">Nick Cave</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Stephen%20Colbert\">Stephen Colbert</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/video\">video</a></p>\n\n         <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/08/hopefulness-is-the-warrior-emotion\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"d4c759537754be417fcfc945647f7d60c15ba96da9554d04202f53af7da70120","category":"Sites"}
