A photon moving at the speed of light crosses three femtometers (a bit more than the radius of oxygen-16) in one baby second.</p></blockquote>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/infoviz\">infoviz</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/physics\">physics</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/science\">science</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/video\">video</a></p>\n\n         <p>ðŸ’¬ <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/11/a-new-visualization-of-the-atomic-nucleus\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> â†’</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"f61564a44cd3cdcafcb14df168fb3175d376f8f09e9dc42171a41bf49b6fa634","category":"Sites"}
