{"title":"The Powerful Density of Hypertextual Writing","link":"https://kottke.org/24/11/the-powerful-density-of-hypertextual-writing","date":1730757236000,"content":"\n        <p>The NY Times has had <a href=\"https://www.semafor.com/article/11/03/2024/in-a-frank-internal-meeting-the-new-york-times-wrestled-with-its-political-role\">a difficult time</a> covering the 2024 election in a clear, responsible manner. But I wanted to highlight <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/02/opinion/vote-harris-2024-election.html\">this short opinion piece</a> from the paperâ€™s editorial board, which Iâ€™m reproducing here in its entirety:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>You already <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/07/18/opinion/trump-presidency-record.html\">know</a> Donald Trump. He is <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/07/11/opinion/editorials/donald-trump-2024-unfit.html\">unfit</a> to lead. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/22/opinion/donald-trump-ezra-klein-podcast.html\">Watch him</a>. Listen to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/09/26/opinion/donald-trump-personality-history.html\">those</a> who know him <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/01/18/opinion/trump-cabinet-election-2024.html\">best</a>. He tried to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/02/opinion/trump-jan-6-indictment.html\">subvert</a> an election and remains a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/06/opinion/trump-2024-campaign-warning.html\">threat</a> to democracy. He helped overturn Roe, with terrible <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/17/opinion/dobbs-roe-abortion-stories.html\">consequences</a>. Mr. Trumpâ€™s <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/10/opinion/trump-presidency-corruption.html\">corruption</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/11/17/opinion/trump-five-major-investigations-dozens-of-ways-out.html\">lawlessness</a> go <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/17/opinion/donald-trump-trial.html\">beyond</a> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/15/opinion/editorials/trump-indictment-republicans.html\">elections</a>: Itâ€™s his whole <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/25/opinion/trump-al-capone.html\">ethos</a>. He <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/24/opinion/trump-lies-charts-data.html\">lies</a> without <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/25/opinion/what-trump-says.html\">limit</a>. If heâ€™s re-elected, the G.O.P. wonâ€™t <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/13/opinion/trump-2024-election.html\">restrain</a> him. Mr. Trump will use the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/12/opinion/donald-trump-culture-decline.html\">government</a> to go after <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/08/opinion/trump-2025-second-term.html?\">opponents</a>. He will pursue a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/14/opinion/trump-debate-haitians-pets.html\">cruel</a> policy of mass <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/18/opinion/trump-woodward-milley-mass-deportation.html\">deportations</a>. He will wreak havoc on the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/09/opinion/harris-trump-debate-issues.html\">poor</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/31/opinion/trump-threat-treasury-market.html\">middle class</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/23/opinion/ceo-trump-republican-support.html\">employers</a>. Another Trump term will damage the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/20/opinion/trump-biden-climate-election.html\">climate</a>, shatter <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/17/opinion/trump-harris-foreign-policy.html\">alliances</a> and strengthen <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/21/opinion/trump-foreign-policy.html\">autocrats</a>. Americans should demand <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/30/opinion/editorials/kamala-harris-2024-endorsement.html\">better</a>. Vote.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>What makes this piece so effective is its plain language and its information density. This density is a real strength of hypertext that is often overlooked and taken for granted. Only 110 words in that paragraph but it contains 27 links to other NYT opinion pieces published over the last several months that expand on each linked statement or argument. If you were inclined to follow these links, you could spend hours reading about how unfit Trump is for office.</p>\n\n<p>A simple list of headlines would have done the same basic job, but by presenting it this way, the Times editorial board is simultaneously able to deliver a strong opinion; each of those links is like a fist pounding on the desk for emphasis. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/24/opinion/trump-lies-charts-data.html\">Lies</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/06/opinion/trump-2024-campaign-warning.html\">threat</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/10/opinion/trump-presidency-corruption.html\">corruption</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/14/opinion/trump-debate-haitians-pets.html\">cruel</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/21/opinion/trump-foreign-policy.html\">autocrats</a> â€” bam! bam! bam! bam! bam! Here! Are! The! Fucking! Receipts!</p>\n\n<p>How the links are deployed is an integral part of how the piece is read; itâ€™s a style of writing that is native to the web, pioneered by sites like <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/03/suck-webzine/473853/?gift=j9r7avb6p-KY8zdjhsiSZ7dBJNxHFlpMESLU-GvViP0\">Suck</a> in the mid-90s. It looks so simple, but IMO, this is top-notch, subtle information design.</p>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/design\">design</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Donald%20Trump\">Donald Trump</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/journalism\">journalism</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/NY%20Times\">NY Times</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/politics\">politics</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/writing\">writing</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/WWW\">WWW</a></p>\n\n         <p>ðŸ’¬ <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/11/the-powerful-density-of-hypertextual-writing\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> â†’</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"9666eabd0ec7933ba128bf249d359c000aa6554297374f3509d953774cc663cd","category":"Sites"}
