Elephants grieve, octopuses remember and predict, crows hold grudges. </p>\n<p>Perhaps one day this too will be snatched from us, but for now there seems to be one tumult of being pulsating in the human breast alone: the capacity to be sorry, to feel the soul-ache of remorse as the penitent past fangs the flesh of the present. </p>\n<p>How to live with remorse, how to make of it a catalyst for creation, is what the philosopher-artist <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/tag/maira-kalman/\">Maira Kalman</a> explores in her small and splendid book <a href=\"https://mairakalman.com/shop/p/limited-edition-still-life-with-remorse\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>Still Life with Remorse</em></strong></a> — a collection of miniature essays, poems, and painted vignettes reckoning with remorse through Maira’s own family story, punctuated by glimpses of the lives of some of her muses: Leo Tolstoy, Clara Schumann, Virginia Woolf, Franz Kafka, Henri Matisse.  </p>\n<figure><a href=\"https://mairakalman.com/shop/p/limited-edition-still-life-with-remorse\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/remorse_Maira_Matisse.jpg?resize=680%2C846&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"680\" height=\"846\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/remorse_Maira_Matisse.jpg?w=986&amp;ssl=1 986w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/remorse_Maira_Matisse.jpg?resize=320%2C398&amp;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/remorse_Maira_Matisse.jpg?resize=600%2C747&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/remorse_Maira_Matisse.jpg?resize=240%2C299&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/remorse_Maira_Matisse.jpg?resize=768%2C956&amp;ssl=1 768w\" /></a><figcaption><em>Objects in Matisse’s Studio</em> by Maira Kalman</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Defining remorse as “deep regret implying shame, implying guilt, implying sorrow,” Maira observes that “in still lifes and interiors there must be a certain amount of remorse lurking among the bowls of fruit, vases or flowers and objects scattered about the room.” </p>\n<p>Rising from the pages is the intimation that memory is the still life of living, that while remorse may haunt the mental images of our recollections, we can find in it an occasion for beauty, for creative vitality, for defiant joy. </p>\n<figure><a href=\"https://mairakalman.com/shop/p/limited-edition-still-life-with-remorse\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/remorse_Maira_Tolstoy.jpg?resize=680%2C833&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"680\" height=\"833\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/remorse_Maira_Tolstoy.jpg?w=1019&amp;ssl=1 1019w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/remorse_Maira_Tolstoy.jpg?resize=320%2C392&amp;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/remorse_Maira_Tolstoy.jpg?resize=600%2C735&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/remorse_Maira_Tolstoy.jpg?resize=240%2C294&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/remorse_Maira_Tolstoy.jpg?resize=768%2C941&amp;ssl=1 768w\" /></a><figcaption><em>Tolstoy Eating Breakfast</em> by Maira Kalman</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Opening with an allusion to that immortal line from <em>Anna Karenina</em> — “All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.” — she considers the half-life of sorrow across generations:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Happy families,<br />\nUnhappy families.<br />\nAll the same, right?<br />\nAch. ach. ach.</p>\n<p>To begin<br />\nYou are born.<br />\nTo a long line of ancestors<br />\nwho are long gone<br />\nbut still yell or whisper<br />\nin your ear<br />\nin the depths of night.<br />\nA game of telephone played<br />\nfrom one generation to the next.</p>\n<p>Garbled and confused.<br />\nGlimmers of light.<br />\nMisunderstandings.<br />\nErrors.</p>\n<p>And now, here you are.<br />\nWith the ones you love.<br />\nOr the ones you don’t.</p>\n<p>The ones you cannot live without.<br />\nThe ones you would like to smite.</p>\n<p>Those who have disappointed you<br />\nor betrayed you.
