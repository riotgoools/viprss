Hong Kong, a succesful Chinese city operating under British law, was one early inspiration. Examples like this fueled criticisms that charter cities were “neo-colonial”. But Charter cities do not inherently require foreign legal frameworks. The fundamental purpose of a charter city is to serve as a discovery platform, a way to explore governance models allowing more people to select from the succesful.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/1-SENAKW-TANDEM-STUDIOS-1024x604.jpg\" width=\"612\" height=\"361\" srcset=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/1-SENAKW-TANDEM-STUDIOS-1024x604.jpg 1024w, https://marginalrevolution.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/1-SENAKW-TANDEM-STUDIOS-300x177.jpg 300w, https://marginalrevolution.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/1-SENAKW-TANDEM-STUDIOS-768x453.jpg 768w, https://marginalrevolution.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/1-SENAKW-TANDEM-STUDIOS-1536x906.jpg 1536w, https://marginalrevolution.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/1-SENAKW-TANDEM-STUDIOS.jpg 2000w\" />An important case in point are the charter cities being created by indigenous Americans in Canada and the United States. In Vancouver, for example, indigenous people have asserted their rights under various treaties to <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://macleans.ca/society/sen%cc%93a%e1%b8%b5w-vancouver/\">control their own land.</a></p>\r\n<blockquote><p>Sen̓áḵw [an 11-tower development on 10 acres in heart of Vancouver, AT] is big, ambitious and undeniably urban—and undeniably Indigenous. It’s being built on reserve land owned by the Squamish First Nation, and it’s spearheaded by the Squamish Nation itself, in partnership with the private real estate developer Westbank. Because the project is on First Nations land, not city land, it’s under Squamish authority, free of Vancouver’s zoning rules. And the Nation has chosen to build bigger, denser and taller than any development on city property would be allowed.</p></blockquote>\r\n<p>Amusingly, some on the progressive left are crestfallen that the indigeneous are behaving like evil capitalist developers and not the back-to-the-land people they had imagined.</p>\r\n<blockquote><p>Predictably, not everyone has been happy about it. Critics have included local planners, politicians and, especially, residents of Kitsilano Point, a rarified beachfront neighbourhood bordering the reserve. And there’s been an extra edge to their critiques that’s gone beyond standard-issue NIMBYism about too-tall buildings and preserving neighbourhood character. There’s also been a persistent sense of disbelief that Indigenous people could be responsible for this futuristic version of urban living. In 2022, Gordon Price, a prominent Vancouver urban planner and a former city councillor, told Gitxsan reporter Angela Sterritt, “When you’re building 30, 40-storey high rises out of concrete, there’s a big gap between that and an Indigenous way of building.”</p>\r\n<p>…. In 2022, city councillor Colleen Hardwick said of [a similar development], “How do you reconcile Indigenous ways of being with 18-storey high-rises?” (Hardwick, it goes without saying, is not Indigenous.)</p>\r\n<p>…<span>What chafes critics, even those who might consider themselves progressive, is that they expect reconciliation to instead look like a kind of reversal, rewinding the tape of history to some museum-diorama past. Coalitions of neighbours near Iy̓álmexw and Sen̓áḵw have offered their own counter-proposals for developing the sites, featuring smaller, shorter buildings and other changes. At the January hearing for Iy̓álmexw, one resident called on the First Nations to build entirely with selectively logged B.C. timber, in accord with what she claimed were their cultural values…That attitude can cast Indigenous people in the role of glorified park rangers.</span></p></blockquote>\r\n<p>There are also some interesting developments in the United States. The Catawba Indian Nation, for example, established the<a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://catawbadigital.zone/\"> Catawba Digital Economic Zone</a> (CDEZ), where I serve as an advisor. The CDEZ is based on US law but tailored for digital entrepreneurs, freelancers, FinTech, digital assets, Web3, and other exponential digital technologies. The progressive left probably isn’t happy about that either. Personally I am delighted to support initiatives that empower indigenous communities through capitalist ventures. More broadly, however, I support the introduction of new governance models to encourage competition in governance—bring on a new era of discovery and Tiebout competition!</p>\r\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/03/indigenous-charter-cities.html\">Indigenous Charter Cities</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com\">Marginal REVOLUTION</a>.</p>\r\n<img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/873598367/0/marginalrevolution\" />\r\n<div><a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/873598367/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/873598367/marginalrevolution,https%3a%2f%2fmarginalrevolution.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2024%2f03%2f1-SENAKW-TANDEM-STUDIOS-1024x604.jpg\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/873598367/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/x.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/873598367/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/873598367/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/03/indigenous-charter-cities.html#comments\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/comments20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/03/indigenous-charter-cities.html/feed\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/commentsrss20.png\" /></a> \r\n<div><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/03/indigenous-charter-cities.html#comments\"><h3>Comments</h3></a><ul><li><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/03/indigenous-charter-cities.html#comment-160730284\">In reply to Sure.
