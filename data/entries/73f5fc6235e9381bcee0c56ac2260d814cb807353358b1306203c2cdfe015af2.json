{"title":"The Secret Message Contained in One Million Checkboxes","link":"https://kottke.org/24/08/secret-message-in-one-million-checkboxes","date":1725023817000,"content":"\n        <p>In <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/08/thanks-xoxo\">my XOXO post</a> on Monday, I said that Nolen Royalty, the creator of <a href=\"https://onemillioncheckboxes.com/\">One Million Checkboxes</a>, had told “one of the wackiest internet nerd stories I’ve ever heard”. Well, Royalty has now put that story online, both in the form of <a href=\"https://eieio.games/essays/the-secret-in-one-million-checkboxes/\">a blog post</a> and a YouTube video:</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<blockquote><p>I panicked. There were URLs in my database! There were URLs pointing to catgirls.win in my database!! Something was very very wrong.</p>\n\n<p>I assumed I’d been hacked. I poured over my logs, looking for evidence of an intrusion. I read and re-read my code, searching for how somebody could be stuffing strings into a database that should have just contained 0s and 1s.</p>\n\n<p>I couldn’t find anything. My access logs looked fine. My (very simple) code was ok. My heart rate increased. My girlfriend patiently waited for me to join her for dinner. And then — wait.</p>\n\n<p>Wait!</p>\n\n<p>I saw it.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>It’s a great story — read/watch the whole thing. It reminds me of the palimpsest (layered communication) that the aliens use to communicate with Earth in Carl Sagan’s <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1501197983/ref=nosim/0sil8\">Contact</a> (and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_(1997_American_film)\">1997 movie</a>). Not only because of the in-game message left for Royalty but for the way that there turned out to be many ways to “play” or “beat” OMCB.</p>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Nolen%20Royalty\">Nolen Royalty</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/video\">video</a></p>\n\n         <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/08/secret-message-in-one-million-checkboxes\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"73f5fc6235e9381bcee0c56ac2260d814cb807353358b1306203c2cdfe015af2","category":"Sites"}
