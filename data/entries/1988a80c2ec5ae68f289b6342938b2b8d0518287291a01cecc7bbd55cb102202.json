If you hadn’t seen this before, (it’s from 2009) take a listen:</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://ablinger.mur.at/txt_qu3god.html\">Deus Cantando</a> is the work of artist Peter Ablinger. He recorded a German school student reciting some text and then composed a tune for the mechanical player to sound like the recitation. I cannot improve upon <a href=\"https://timbreandorchestration.org/writings/amazing-moments-in-timbre/2019/2/13/deus-cantando\">Jason Noble’s description of the work</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>This is not digital manipulation, nor a digitally programmed piano like a Disklavier. This is a normal, acoustic piano, any old piano. The mechanism performing it consists of 88 electronically controlled, mechanical “fingers,” synchronized with superhuman speed and accuracy to replicate the spectral content of a child’s voice. Watching the above-linked video, it may seem that the speech is completely intelligible, but this is partially an illusion. The visual prompt of the words on the screen are an essential cue: take them away, and it becomes much harder to understand the words. But it is still remarkable that the auditory system is able to group discrete notes from a piano into such a close approximation of a continuous human voice, and that Ablinger was able to do this so convincingly using a conventional instrument (albeit, played robotically).</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>This is so cool, I can’t believe I’d never seen it before.
