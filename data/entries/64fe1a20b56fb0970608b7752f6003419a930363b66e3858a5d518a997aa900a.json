{"title":"Knitting Anything?","link":"https://kottke.org/24/02/knitting-anything","date":1708720704000,"content":"\n        <p><img src=\"/plus/misc/images/knittinghands1.jpeg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"637\" alt=\"knittinghands1.jpeg\" /></p>\n\n<p>I know there are some knitters around here, and Iâ€™m curious what people are making, if anyone cares to share. Iâ€™ve been knitting a <a href=\"https://www.purlsoho.com/create/2021/11/21/nine-note-seed-stitch-wrap/\">Nine Note Seed Stitch Wrap</a> for the past couple months. Next Iâ€™d like to finally try making a Junko Okamoto <a href=\"https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/tanaka\">sweater</a>, or maybe a James Watts <a href=\"https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/pixel-tweed-pullover\">sweater</a>. And Iâ€™d really love to make this sweet guernsey <a href=\"https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/billes-sweater\">kidsâ€™ sweater</a> by Susie Haumann, but so far the pattern is only in Danish. And if Iâ€™m being honest Iâ€™ll probably just make something mindless (but no less pleasing).</p>\n\n <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/knitting\">knitting</a></p>\n\n <p>ðŸ’¬ <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/02/knitting-anything\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> â†’</p>\n\n    ","author":"Edith Zimmerman","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"64fe1a20b56fb0970608b7752f6003419a930363b66e3858a5d518a997aa900a","category":"default"}
