We need great turnout this year, record-setting turnout, as a show of love for our country and our Constitution. Vote now, because later you might not have any power to change direction. Tomorrow, you do have power. <b>And remember that voting is not you expressing yourself, it's not free speech, it's you and I governing. </b>This is our moment of greatest power. Use it or lose it.","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"4b13fe6d42c17427deb49a07b14c8a08c8020743cf658892abe54781b494d6e6","category":"Sites"}
