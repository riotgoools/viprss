Beyond her writing, Robinson’s 25-year tenure at the famed Iowa Writers’ Workshop allowed her to shape and inspire the new generations of writers. Her latest book, <em>Reading Genesis, </em>displays her scholarly prowess, analyzing the biblical text not only through the lens of religious doctrine but also appreciating it as a literary masterpiece.</p>\r\n<p>She joined Tyler to discuss betrayal and brotherhood in the Hebrew Bible, the relatable qualities of major biblical figures, how to contend with the Bible’s seeming contradictions, the true purpose of Levitical laws, whether we’ve transcended the need for ritual sacrifice, the role of the Antichrist, the level of biblical knowledge among students, her preferred Bible translation, whether <em>The Winter’s Tale</em> makes sense, the evolution of Calvin’s reputation and influence, why academics are overwhelmingly secular, the success of the Iowa Writer’s Workshop, why she wrote a book on nuclear pollution, what she’ll do next, and more.</p></blockquote>\r\n<p>And an excerpt:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>As a Calvinist, too, would not, in general, dismiss the Old Testament, what do you make of a book such as <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.britannica.com/topic/Leviticus\" target=\"_blank\">Leviticus</a>? It’s highly legalistic, highly ritualistic. Some Christians read Leviticus and become a split Christian Jew almost. Other Christians more or less dismiss the book. How does it fit into your worldview?</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBINSON: </strong>I think that when you read Herodotus, where he describes these little civilizations that are scattered over his world — he describes them in terms of what they eat or prohibit, or they paint themselves red, or they shave half their head. There are all these very arbitrary distinctions that people make in order to identify with one clan over against another.</p>\r\n<p>At the point of Leviticus, which of course, is an accumulation of many texts over a very long time, no doubt, but nevertheless, to think of it as being Moses — he is trying to create a defined, distinctive human community. By making arbitrary distinctions between people so that you’re not simply replicating notions of what is available or feasible or whatever, but actually asking them to adopt prohibitions of food — that’s a very common distinguishing thing in Herodotus and in contemporary life.</p>\r\n<p>So, the arbitrariness of the laws is not a fault. It is a way of establishing identification of one group as separate from other groups.</p>\r\n<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>So, you read it as a narrative of how human communities are created, but you still would take a reading of, say, <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.britannica.com/topic/Sermon-on-the-Mount\" target=\"_blank\">Sermon on the Mount</a> that the Mosaic law has been lifted? Or it’s still in place?</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBINSON: </strong>Oh, it’s not still in place. We’ve been given other means by which to create identity. Moses was doing something distinctive in a certain period of the evolution of Israel as a people. He didn’t want them to be Egyptians. He didn’t want them to subscribe to the prevailing culture, which was idolatrous, and so on. He’s doing Plato in <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://iep.utm.edu/republic/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Republic</em></a>. He’s saying, “This is how we develop the idea of a community.”</p>\r\n<p>Having said that, then there are certain other things like “Thou shall not kill,” or whatever, that become characterizing laws. Jesus very often says, when someone says to him, “How can I be saved?” He says, “You know the commandments.” It’s not as if God is an alien figure from the point of view of Christ, whom we take to be his son.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Interesting throughout.</p>\r\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/03/my-excellent-conversation-with-marilynne-robinson.html\">My excellent Conversation with Marilynne Robinson</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com\">Marginal REVOLUTION</a>.</p>\r\n<img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/874076507/0/marginalrevolution\" />\r\n<div><a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/874076507/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/874076507/marginalrevolution,\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/874076507/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/x.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/874076507/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/874076507/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/03/my-excellent-conversation-with-marilynne-robinson.html#comments\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/comments20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/03/my-excellent-conversation-with-marilynne-robinson.html/feed\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/commentsrss20.png\" /></a> \r\n<div><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/03/my-excellent-conversation-with-marilynne-robinson.html#comments\"><h3>Comments</h3></a><ul><li><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/03/my-excellent-conversation-with-marilynne-robinson.html#comment-160733392\">In reply to Sand Wizard.
