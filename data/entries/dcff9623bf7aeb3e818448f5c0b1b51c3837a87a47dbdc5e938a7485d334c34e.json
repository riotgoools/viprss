Yes, I think it can be. For some reason people thought I'd say no. In 2003, I compiled a list of <a href=\"https://archive.blogs.harvard.edu/whatmakesaweblogaweblog/\">things that make a blog a blog</a>, and it's not about the software you use, rather it's about who's writing it, and whether they're being edited. Now it's a different question to ask if I would use it. I would not. Because it forces you to use their editor. And that's a <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=pernicious\">pernicious</a> form of lock-in. It might sound like a small thing, but it means you can't easily try out something new. You are not available to other software developers as a possible user, so no software will be designed for you. I know how well that kind of system works. And that's probably why they lock you into using their editor. If I can't switch without breaking everything, I'm not going there.","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"dcff9623bf7aeb3e818448f5c0b1b51c3837a87a47dbdc5e938a7485d334c34e","category":"Sites"}
