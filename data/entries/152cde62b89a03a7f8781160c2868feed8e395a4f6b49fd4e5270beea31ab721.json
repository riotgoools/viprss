It’s a subscription-based app that sells high-res wallpapers for your phone. First and foremost, the idea that someone would care enough about the wallpaper on their iPhone to PAY FOR IT requires such an advanced level of Apple guy brain rot that I actually can’t even imagine it. And the idea that someone out there is changing their phone’s wallpaper regularly enough to pay a $12-a-month subscription for new ones chills me to the bone.</p><p>And it seems that I am not the only one who has a hard time imagining the utility of such an app. Brownlee is being roasted across the web by, it seems, every single person in <a href=\"https://x.com/turnernovak/status/1838738743437471848?s=12&amp;t=GArJOEJ41SKT7sLfzFsugQ&amp;utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=marques-brownlee-s-hot-new-app\" target=\"_blank\">Silicon Valley</a> right now. They are tearing the app apart on a <a href=\"https://x.com/1owroller/status/1838636737272385827?s=12&amp;t=GArJOEJ41SKT7sLfzFsugQ&amp;utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=marques-brownlee-s-hot-new-app\" target=\"_blank\">technical level</a>. And have <a href=\"https://x.com/uwukko/status/1838640932167503998?s=12&amp;t=GArJOEJ41SKT7sLfzFsugQ&amp;utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=marques-brownlee-s-hot-new-app\" target=\"_blank\">already figured out</a> how to bypass the paywall and just download all of the wallpapers for free lol.</p><p>The immediate backlash was so strong that Brownlee <a href=\"https://x.com/mkbhd/status/1838582554749755438?s=12&amp;t=GArJOEJ41SKT7sLfzFsugQ&amp;utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=marques-brownlee-s-hot-new-app\" target=\"_blank\">has already put out</a> a “listening and learning” statement much like many of the AI wearable startups that were sent scrambling this year after Brownlee trashed their products. As Product Hunt’s Jason Levin <a href=\"https://x.com/iamjasonlevin/status/1838412337784525229?s=12&amp;t=GArJOEJ41SKT7sLfzFsugQ&amp;utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=marques-brownlee-s-hot-new-app\" target=\"_blank\">wrote</a>, “The critic has stepped in the arena,” and it seems fair to say that he has not performed very well. Unless…</p><p>OK, no, I am not going to defend the app. It sucks ass and is a patently absurd thing to release. But it’s also an important illustration of how Brownlee is not — and has never been — playing the same game as the companies he reviews. And, unlike, say, the AI hardware companies he’s ethered in videos this summer, he has a much better sense of who his customers are and where his money comes from than they do. </p><p>Brownlee is a YouTuber. That’s where all of his content is hosted and that’s where the bulk of his revenue comes from. And his audience, I’m willing to bet, is overwhelmingly young men who buy new gadgets to show them off. The aforementioned brain-rotted Apple guys. Panels was, <a href=\"https://x.com/LuisChavezTV/status/1838624487098417617?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=marques-brownlee-s-hot-new-app\" target=\"_blank\">as of last night</a>, number three on the App Store charts. So yeah, there are clearly people this app is catering to. Is this also a shameless cash grab? Of course (it also has ads lol). Is it also clearly targeting a specific kind of person with a specific kind of “need”? Clearly. Something Silicon Valley should probably consider!</p><hr /><p><i>The following is a paid ad.

I literally sat up in bed when I saw the above post on X this morning. It’s a classic viral post format — “look at this big cat” — but it was generated by AI. In case you need proof, if you watch it, at the very end, parts of the background start moving on their own.</p><p>It was originally posted by an account called @Lily19911707, which only has 13 followers, and was then shared by an account called @gunsnrosesgirl3, which has 2.6 million followers and is Verified on X. This, itself, btw, is a common content hack on X right now. Where bigger accounts use burner accounts to post videos and share them over to the main feed. I think it’s a way to trick X’s terrible algorithm into thinking the video is being shared organically.</p><p>But back to the AI factor here. Basically, up until now, AI video has not been good enough to fully replace real viral clips. The fact that random bull shit accounts are now starting to experiment with it, though, is a huge deal. A true snake eating its own tail moment for social media as a concept.</p><hr /><h2>Those Who Do Not Learn From DashCon Are Doomed To Repeat DashCon</h2><div><img src=\"https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/d4cfb913-3146-430f-855c-0b5cd2579486/Screenshot_2024-09-25_at_11.57.44_AM.png?t=1727258280\" /><div><span><p>(<a href=\"https://x.com/rayleearts/status/1838588221006967112?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=marques-brownlee-s-hot-new-app\" target=\"_blank\">x.com/rayleearts</a>)</p></span></div></div><p><i>Bridgerton</i> fans in Detroit are saying they were scammed by a company called Uncle &amp; Me LLC (lol) after they paid $300 for an event that made DashCon look like <i>Sleep No More</i>. </p><p>You can <a href=\"https://x.com/rayleearts/status/1838588221006967112?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=marques-brownlee-s-hot-new-app\" target=\"_blank\">click here</a> for a thread with some truly incredible photos and videos of the event.

She says she’s not voting for Trump. Like with everything she does, in the video she’s articulate and smart and shows that she’s clearly thinking about how <a href=\"https://x.com/femme_thoughts/status/1838749805268312305?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=marques-brownlee-s-hot-new-app\" target=\"_blank\">to be deliberate</a> about her new fame.</p><p>The fact that the internet this week is losing its mind over Roan while also <a href=\"https://x.com/desivirgil/status/1838619991320482083?s=12&amp;t=GArJOEJ41SKT7sLfzFsugQ&amp;utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=marques-brownlee-s-hot-new-app\" target=\"_blank\">tearing apart</a> a random fan caught on camera at a recent Charli XCX concert at the same time that a stan <a href=\"https://x.com/TheTekShow/status/1838649436454453709?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=marques-brownlee-s-hot-new-app\" target=\"_blank\">was livetweeting</a> her stalking of actor Evan Peters feels like a real line in the sand moment for stan culture. This whole year has felt like a real reckoning for fandom. What does it mean? What is it worth? Who does it serve? If the 2010s was a period where brands and celebrities slowly acquiesced to the most intense and deranged online fan communities, it feels like the 2020s are a swing of the pendulum back in the opposite direction. And I wouldn’t be surprised if online fandoms start getting pushed towards the fringes again. Which is, honestly, probably where they should have stayed. (Except for Garbage Day fans. You are all my friends and I love you.)</p><hr /><h2><span>What Are Next?!</span></h2><hr /><div><h2><span>Did you know Garbage Day has a merch store?</span></h2><div><img src=\"https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/51eefe2c-07bf-408c-a27d-887ea8b2f580/Screenshot_2024-05-23_at_4.33.09_PM.png?t=1716493112\" /></div><p><span><b><a href=\"https://internetgarbage.creator-spring.com/?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=marques-brownlee-s-hot-new-app\" target=\"_blank\">You can check it out here!</a></b></span></p><hr /></div><h2>Some Stray Links</h2><ul><li><p><a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/article/why-do-men-comment-porn-sites.html?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=marques-brownlee-s-hot-new-app\" target=\"_blank\">“Why Do Men Even Comment on Porn Sites?”</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://www.platformer.news/leaving-substack-platformer-year-four/?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=marques-brownlee-s-hot-new-app\" target=\"_blank\">“What I learned in year four of Platformer”</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://theface.com/music/new-york-underground-rave-scene-parties-report?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=marques-brownlee-s-hot-new-app\" target=\"_blank\">“On the frontlines of New York’s renegade rave scene”</a></p></li></ul><hr /><p>P.S. here’s <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/comments/1flkj6j/this_is_wink182_and_its_her_4thish_birthday_today/?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=marques-brownlee-s-hot-new-app\" target=\"_blank\">Wink-182</a>.</p><p><i>***Any typos in this email are on purpose actually***</i></p></div><div><br /><hr /><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.beehiiv.com/?utm_campaign=4d410552-646e-4d03-981f-56b8ed8e0909&amp;utm_medium=post_rss&amp;utm_source=garbage_day\">Powered by beehiiv</a></div></div>","author":"Ryan Broderick","siteTitle":"Garbage Day","siteHash":"f6f2268f28b352c16d6836ba0dcf62d1334588ef4ccbdcbdd896fc6dd07bbcb7","entryHash":"152cde62b89a03a7f8781160c2868feed8e395a4f6b49fd4e5270beea31ab721","category":"Sites"}
