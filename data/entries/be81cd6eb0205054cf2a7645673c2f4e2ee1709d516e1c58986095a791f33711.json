I learned a lot in the interview including the real history of the ZEDE movement (e.g. it didn’t begin with Paul Romer). I also had not fully appreciated the power of reciprocity stacking.</p>\r\n<p>Companies in Prospera have the unique option to select their regulatory framework from any OECD country, among others. Erick Brimen elaborated in the podcast how this enables companies to do normal, OECD approved, things in Prospera which literally could not be done legally anywhere else in the world.</p>\r\n<blockquote><p>…so in the medical world for instance you have drugs that are approved in some countries but not others and you have medical practitioners that are licensed in some countries but not the others and you have medical devices approved in some countries but not others and there’s like a mismatch of things that are approved in OECD countries but there’s no one location where you can say hey if they’re approved in any country they’re approved here. That is what Prosper is….Our hypothesis is that just by doing that we can leapfrog to a certain extent and it’s got nothing to do with the wild west or doing weird things.</p>\r\n<p>…so here so you can have a drug approved in the UK but not in the US with a doctor licensed in the US but not in the UK with a medical device created in Israel but not yet approved by the FDA following a procedure that has been say innovated in Canada, all of that coming together here in Prospera.</p></blockquote>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/03/in-conversation-with-prospera-ceo-erick-brimen-vitalia-co-founder-niklas-anzinger.html\">In Conversation with Próspera CEO Erick Brimen &amp; Vitalia Co-Founder Niklas Anzinger</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com\">Marginal REVOLUTION</a>.</p>\r\n<img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/873371267/0/marginalrevolution\" />\r\n<div><a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/873371267/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/873371267/marginalrevolution,\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/873371267/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/x.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/873371267/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/873371267/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/03/in-conversation-with-prospera-ceo-erick-brimen-vitalia-co-founder-niklas-anzinger.html#comments\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/comments20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/03/in-conversation-with-prospera-ceo-erick-brimen-vitalia-co-founder-niklas-anzinger.html/feed\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/commentsrss20.png\" /></a> \r\n<div><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/03/in-conversation-with-prospera-ceo-erick-brimen-vitalia-co-founder-niklas-anzinger.html#comments\"><h3>Comments</h3></a><ul><li><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/03/in-conversation-with-prospera-ceo-erick-brimen-vitalia-co-founder-niklas-anzinger.html#comment-160727882\">Prospera is on an island (Roatan), and is managed by Honduras ...</a> <i>by rayward</i></li><li><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/03/in-conversation-with-prospera-ceo-erick-brimen-vitalia-co-founder-niklas-anzinger.html#comment-160727867\">There are plenty of places where you an have a drug approved in ...</a> <i>by Umm</i></li></ul></div><h3>Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/03/what-can-be-learned-from-singaporean-health-care-institutions.html?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=what-can-be-learned-from-singaporean-health-care-institutions\">What can be learned from Singaporean health care institutions?</a></li><li><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/03/as-it-should-be.html?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=as-it-should-be\">As it should be</a></li><li><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/03/a-different-perspective-on-power-grid-yimby-and-nimby-from-my-email.html?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=a-different-perspective-on-power-grid-yimby-and-nimby-from-my-email\">A different perspective on power grid YIMBY and NIMBY (from my email)</a></li></ul> </div>","author":"Alex Tabarrok","siteTitle":"Marginal Revolution","siteHash":"242a3a39129b36e0c574c3796ca7ef3cf8af967286c2998fabf7240d1ad52a47","entryHash":"be81cd6eb0205054cf2a7645673c2f4e2ee1709d516e1c58986095a791f33711","category":"default"}
