{"title":"Gou Miyagi Skates Very Mellow","link":"https://kottke.org/24/03/gou-miyagi-skates-very-mellow","date":1711595855000,"content":"\n        <p>I like the skate videos where the skaters show how high or fast or far they can go and the control they have over their bodies while flying through the air, but I also like the videos where the skaters put their feet on the ground sometimes and use the board as more than something to ride on, as a prop. Gou Miyagi does a lot of tricks like that, riding up to a set of steps, running up the rail, sliding down on his butt, and landing on the board, and skating off, things of that nature. It all looks very nice.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/gou%20miyagi\">gou miyagi</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/skateboarding\">skateboarding</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/skating\">skating</a></p>\n\n <p>ðŸ’¬ <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/03/gou-miyagi-skates-very-mellow\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> â†’</p>\n\n    ","author":"Aaron Cohen","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"fd182df66478833926136ba0aae3fd06f6b45d85a301de45b09a85ebb9a0d26a","category":"default"}
