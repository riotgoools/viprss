There will always be doubters who question what’s possible. Seth Godin recently <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://seths.blog/2024/08/the-power-of-a-risky-scheme/\">put this idea well:</a></p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“New ideas aren’t adopted all at once. A few people go first while the rest of us watch to see how it goes. This is the story of tech innovations, dance crazes and even food.Ideas spread horizontally, and people who prefer the status quo will embrace an idea only when they feel as though they don’t have much of a choice.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>In 1995, I held a view diametrically opposed to this writer’s view. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr />\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Exabytes’R’Us</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The exabyte era is firmly here.  To think that at at the turn of the century we had a telecom bubble and how overvalued everything seemed. Fast forward to today, and look where where we are. When I reflect on it, what a unique opportunity it has been to experience such a transformative period.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>I thought about data in exabytes nearly 20 years ago. Recently, I found this fact: Google moves 1.2 exabytes of data worldwide on its own network daily for “backup”? <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3651890.3672262\" target=\"_blank\">Link</a> </li>\n\n\n\n<li>We’ve come far since 2010, when a year’s mobile data <a href=\"https://om.co/gigaom/in-2010-us-mobile-data-traffic-to-top-1-exabyte/\" target=\"_blank\">was just over an exabyte</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The US app market made <a href=\"https://www.businessofapps.com/data/us-app-market/\" target=\"_blank\">$44.9 billion</a> in 2023. Smartphone users spent <a href=\"https://www.businessofapps.com/data/us-app-market/\" target=\"_blank\">217 billion hours</a> on their apps. <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/complicated-app-settings-are-a-threat-to-user-privacy-235842\" target=\"_blank\">Link</a> </li>\n\n\n\n<li>It’s no wonder our data usage is going up and up. OpenVault estimates that for the second quarter of 2024, the monthly average data usage was 585.8 GB, up 9.7% year over year from 533.8 GB in 2Q23. About 20% of broadband users are now consuming 1 terabyte (or more) data, with some using as much as 5 TB. <a href=\"https://openvault.com/openvault-20-of-broadband-users-to-hit-1-tb-per-month-in-2024/\" target=\"_blank\">Link</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<hr />\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>5 Very Important Reads</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Who is Palmer Luckey?
