The owner, Jim Rizzo is a character, and the article is full of nuggets like: </p>\n\n<blockquote><p>“I think the love of neon is still there, but because budgets are tight, people are going to LED fake neon. Have you seen that stuff? It’s trying to look like neon, but it’s plastic with little diodes embedded in it. … Nobody makes it in America.”</p></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote><p>Rizzo handles the installations, which means he often finds himself hanging 16 stories up in a bosun chair tinkering with hotel signs. He can handle the dizzying elevation: “I love heights.” What he can’t stand are the pigeons. “I will kill a pigeon in a heartbeat, I hate them,” he jokes. “The Avenue Theatre sign (in San Francisco) was so dilapidated and filled with pigeons that every day we pulled up to it, we were just like, ‘Uhhhhhgh.’”</p></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote><p>“Tube bending” is the term for heating and shaping neon tubes with almost medieval-like flame torches – the trade is full of such wonderful terms, including “slumping” (when a tube sinks down from gravity), “blockout paint” (black pigment used to create the illusion of letter breaks) and “bombarding” (electrifying a tube to clean out impurities).</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>(via <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/notacquiescing.bsky.social/post/3lbe5ipsui22r\">@notacquiescing.bsky.social</a>)</p>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/design\">design</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Jim%20Rizzo\">Jim Rizzo</a></p>\n\n         <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/11/neon-the-most-noble-of-signs\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Aaron Cohen","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"e0687d41bcde2798f45484f444d0bb6d8663a7927e3228b586af91f8d4f1a2f3","category":"Sites"}
