It’s about how difficult it can be as a creative person to find your way to making work that feels like it’s uniquely yours.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>There are two dozen platforms, Minkkinen explains, from each of which several different bus lines depart. Thereafter, for a kilometre or more, all the lines leaving from any one platform take the same route out of the city, making identical stops. “Each bus stop represents one year in the life of a photographer,” Minkkinen says. You pick a career direction — maybe you focus on making platinum prints of nudes — and set off. Three stops later, you’ve got a nascent body of work. “You take those three years of work on the nude to [a gallery], and the curator asks if you are familiar with the nudes of Irving Penn.” Penn’s bus, it turns out, was on the same route. Annoyed to have been following someone else’s path, “you hop off the bus, grab a cab… and head straight back to the bus station, looking for another platform”. Three years later, something similar happens. “This goes on all your creative life: always showing new work, always being compared to others.” What’s the answer? “It’s simple. Stay on the bus. Stay on the fucking bus.”</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>(via <a href=\"https://www.gyford.com/\">phil gyford</a>)</p>\n\n <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Arno%20Minkkinen\">Arno Minkkinen</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/art\">art</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Oliver%20Burkeman\">Oliver Burkeman</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/photography\">photography</a></p>\n\n <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/04/helsinki-bus-station-theory-of-creativity\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"407a261d69f716267efe1ef53ed9c446490720448bad3dbeb3e7f4e2af1add62","category":"default"}
