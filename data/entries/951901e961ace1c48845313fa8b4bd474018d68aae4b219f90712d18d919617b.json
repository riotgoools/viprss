{"title":"The Most Iconic Electronic Music Sample of Every Year (1990-2023)","link":"https://kottke.org/24/11/the-most-iconic-electronic-music-sample-of-every-year-1990-2023","date":1732731674000,"content":"\n        <p></p>\n\n<p>Oh man this is so great: electronic music sample breakdowns from 1990 until the present day. The visualizations on these are <em>fantastic</em> â€” just watch a bit of the first one (Groove Is In The Heart) and youâ€™ll see what I mean. Theyâ€™re not all that great (some of these producers are out here working harder than others, is what Iâ€™m saying), but these are some of my favorites:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Groove Is In The Heart by Dee-Lite (Eva Gabor Green Acres sample!)</li>\n\n<p><li>Firestarter by The Prodigy (sample from The Breeders?)</li></p>\n\n<p><li>Praise You by Fatboy Slim (Itâ€™s a Small World from Mickey Mouse Disco? Fat Albert Theme?!)</li></p>\n\n<p><li>One More Time by Daft Punk</li></p>\n\n<p><li>Robot Rock by Daft Punk</li></p>\n\n<p><li>Archangel by Burial</li></p>\n\n<p><li>First of the Year by Skrillex</li></p>\n\n<p><li>Girl by Jamie xx</li></p>\n\n<p><li>Pick Up by DJ Koze</li></p>\n\n<p><li>leavemealone by Fred again</li></p></ul><p></p>\n\n<p>Is DJ Shadow electronic? I would have liked to have seen something from Endtroducingâ€¦ but maybe they couldnâ€™t even locate the samples. ðŸ˜‚</p>\n\n<p>I could have also gone for more Daft Punk, but I guess you need to let others have a shot. Luckily the same channel has <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AqHSvR9bqs\">breakdowns of a few more Daft Punk tunes from Discovery</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXNFDbRjGts\">an extended breakdown of One More Time</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Also from the same channel (and even better IMO): <a href=\"https://kottke.org/23/08/the-most-iconic-hip-hop-sample-of-every-year-1973-2023\">The Most Iconic Hip-Hop Sample of Every Year (1973-2023)</a>.</p>\n\n<p>See also <a href=\"https://kottke.org/17/12/the-making-of-burials-untrue\">The Making of Burialâ€™s Untrue</a>.</p>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/infoviz\">infoviz</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/music\">music</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/remix\">remix</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/video\">video</a></p>\n\n         <p>ðŸ’¬ <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/11/the-most-iconic-electronic-music-sample-of-every-year-1990-2023\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> â†’</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"951901e961ace1c48845313fa8b4bd474018d68aae4b219f90712d18d919617b","category":"Sites"}
