One is profoundly changed by it and yet becomes more purely oneself as projections give way to presence and complexes are composted into candid relation. </p>\n<p>In his slender and splendid book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Twice-Alive-Forrest-Gander/dp/0811230295?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>Twice Alive</em></strong></a> (<a href=\"https://search.worldcat.org/title/1201298777\" target=\"_blank\"><em>public library</em></a>), poet, geologist, and translator Forrest Gander draws from the natural world a poetic “ecology of intimacies,” reverencing lichens’ “supreme parsimony in drought” and the “long soft sarongs of moss” as a way “to recover the play of life itself.”</p>\n<p>An epoch after Beatrix Potter <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2015/07/28/beatrix-potter-a-life-in-nature-botany-mycology-fungi/\">uncovered how lichens reproduce</a> — asexually, scattering living matter from both partners to colonize a new habitat — Gander considers the “theoretical immortality” of such propagation and reflects:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The thought of two things that merge, mutually altering each other, two things that, intermingled and interactive, become one thing that does not age, brings me to think of the nature of intimacy. Isn’t it often in our most intimate relations that we come to realize that our identity, all identity, is combinatory?</p></blockquote>\n<p>I think of Einstein, who considered <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2013/08/14/how-einstein-thought-combinatorial-creativity/\">“combinatory play”</a> the essence of creativity; I think of how love may be the supreme creative act, the way it remakes the self and the world between selves. </p>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2015/02/12/the-missing-piece-meets-the-big-o-shel-silverstein/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/themissingpiecemeetsthebigo8.jpg\" /></a><figcaption>Art from <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2015/02/12/the-missing-piece-meets-the-big-o-shel-silverstein/\"><em>The Missing Piece Meets the Big O</em></a> by Shel Silverstein</figcaption></figure>\n<p>In one of the love poems anchoring the books, Gander considers how in such combinatorics of intimacy the partners are “not fused, not bonded, but nested.” Echoing the defiant question Mary McCarthy <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2016/06/10/mary-mccarthy-hannah-arendt-love/\">posed to Hannah Arendt</a> — <em>What’s the use of falling in love if you both remain inertly as-you-were?</em> — he writes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The reconfiguration is instantaneous<br />\nexperience. It is <em>being<br />\nitself</em>. But whose being now? Was I<br />\nendowed with some special pliability so<br />\nthat becoming part of you I didn’t pass<br />\nthrough my own nihilation? And what<br />\ndoes the death of who-you-were mean to me<br />\nexcept that now you are present, constantly.</p>\n<p>[…]</p>\n<p>Without you I survived and with you<br />\nI live again in a radical augmentation<br />\nof identity because we have<br />\neffaced our outer limits, because<br />\nwe summoned each other. In you,<br />\nI cast my life beyond itself.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This radical augmentation of the self is indeed the great recompense of intimacy, not only interpersonal but ecological — how organisms entwine with one another to become a system of interdependence greater and more fully alive than its parts, how grasping this new way of being requires a new way of seeing. Gander writes in another poem:</p>\n<blockquote><p>To see what’s there and not already<br />\npatterned by familiarity — for an unpredicted<br />\nwhole is there, casting a pair of shadows, manipulating<br />\nits material, advancing, assembling enough<br />\nkinship that we call it <em>life</em>, our life, what<br />\nis already many lives, the dimensions of<br />\nits magnitude veiled to us as we live it —</p></blockquote>\n<p>Complement with Ursula K. Le Guin’s poem <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2021/10/20/ursula-k-le-guin-kinship-poem/\">“Kinship”</a> and Shel Silverstein’s timeless <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2015/02/12/the-missing-piece-meets-the-big-o-shel-silverstein/\">illustrated parable about the secret to nurturing relationships</a>, then revisit this meditation on <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2023/03/25/lichens/\">lichens and the meaning of life</a>.</p>\n<hr /><h3>donating = loving</h3><p>For seventeen years, I have been spending hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars each month composing <em>The Marginalian</em> (which <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2021/10/22/brain-pickings-becoming-the-marginalian/\">bore the outgrown name <em>Brain Pickings</em></a> for its first fifteen years).
