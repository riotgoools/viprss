I’ve always wanted to live more fully on the non-duality spectrum of home and travel — <em>to make travel feel more like home, and home more like travel.</em> <br /><br />I think this practice begins with centering a nourishing <em>life</em>, rather than only centering work (as much as I love my work). then, to create space for small rituals of discovery and adventure, inside the spaces of an ordinary day. the practice of presence always seems to be the <a href=\"https://keningzhu.com/journal/the-master-key-to-everything\" target=\"_blank\">master key</a> for this. so, for now, I’ll start there. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n<hr />\n\n\n  <p><strong>see more:</strong> <br /><a href=\"https://keningzhu.com/journal/the-web-of-life-inner-world-material-immaterial\">the web of life: inner, world, material, immaterial</a><br /><a href=\"https://keningzhu.com/journal/the-rhythm-of-processing-daily-life-vs-travel\">the rhythm of processing: daily life vs. travel</a><br /><a href=\"https://keningzhu.com/journal/how-to-feel-at-home-anywhere\" target=\"_blank\">how to feel at home anywhere</a><br /><br /></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n  ","author":"Kening Zhu","siteTitle":"kening zhu","siteHash":"ef8a94b9fc20c32a4ee7d94ee971337d278e8b2fafe747123e4eb5cea026e84e","entryHash":"1b8d2e44ddcf81b03395f9333fc9f1c72b26a982fb77910e325a367e95f7a393","category":"Sites"}
