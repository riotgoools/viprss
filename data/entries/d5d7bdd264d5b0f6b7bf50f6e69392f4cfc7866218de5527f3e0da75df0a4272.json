It occurred to me watching a Martin Scorcese <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Harrison:_Living_in_the_Material_World\">documentary</a> about the life of George Harrison, how much people in music seek out opportunities to create with other musicians. In technology, it doesn't happen, we don't even look at each others software. After waiting a whole lifetime for a culture of collaboration, we have had it for short periods, but it's most of the time it's been people trying to deconstruct and reinvent other people's work, not build on it. I'm still open to this changing. I hope to be a catalyst for it, one more time.","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"d5d7bdd264d5b0f6b7bf50f6e69392f4cfc7866218de5527f3e0da75df0a4272","category":"default"}
