{"title":"Silicon Valley’s Empathy Vacuum","link":"https://om.co/2024/05/27/silicon-valleys-empathy-vacuum/","date":1716831139000,"content":"<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://creatoreconomy.so/p/scott-belsky-collapsing-the-talent-stack-with-ai\">In a recent podcast</a>, Adobe Chief Product Officer Scott Belsky said that startups and founders jump into the fray and desire to do the impossible but overlook one small thing — empathy. I have talked about the need for empathy for more than a decade now — in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://t.co/Gek0updej4\">2013</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://t.co/ZZyaR4B6xk\">2014</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://t.co/tXg8kwO7CB\">2016,</a> and then in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://t.co/Oz5r5GMoIx\">2017</a>. I am glad Scott is taking up the issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“What should have driven you instead is empathy for the customer and their problem. What should have driven you instead is empathy for the customer and their problem. You should’ve gone shoulder to shoulder with them to identify this problem first before crafting your vision. Yes, the cheat code of course is to solve your own problem, like many successful founders do. You’re the customer so you collapse the stack of empathy.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>I believe Scott’s prescription is very narrow. It highlights the bigger problem we have around these parts. We think of products, technologies and their impacts in isolation. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In my books, empathy goes beyond all that. It is about the impact of what our product does and how it makes people feel that defines empathy. I have made this argument enough times and eventually stopped because around here in Silicon Valley, having empathy is viewed as a sign of weakness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is what I wrote in my 2016 piece for The New Yorker, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://t.co/tXg8kwO7CB\">Silicon Valley Has an Empathy Vacuum”:</a></p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>It’s hard to think about the human consequences of technology as a founder of a startup racing to prove itself or as a chief executive who is worried about achieving the incessant growth that keeps investors happy. However, when you are a data-driven oligarchy like Facebook, Google, Amazon, or Uber, you can’t really wash your hands of the impact of your algorithms and your ability to shape popular sentiment in our society.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>It has only gotten worse since then — and the latest onslaught of AI-inspired fears only reinforces the empathy vacuum.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>May 27, 2024.
