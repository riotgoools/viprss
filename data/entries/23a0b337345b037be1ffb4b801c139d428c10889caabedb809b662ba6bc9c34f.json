Isn’t there good evidence that fraternities raise wages?</p>\r\n<p><strong>STIGLITZ: </strong>[laughs] That was <em>unions</em> raise wages. Fraternities — I was opposed to fraternities because Amherst was a small college, a thousand boys, men, and they had the effect of <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.marketwatch.com/story/how-fraternities-exacerbate-inequality-2017-10-26\" target=\"_blank\">dividing the community</a>. The philosophy that <em>I </em>had was that we should be one community. The fraternities tended to interfere with that. Students from one fraternity would always sit at dinner at the same tables with the members of their fraternity. There were class aspects of fraternities.</p>\r\n<p>They were just, I thought, very divisive in a small community, and it turned out that my perspective eventually prevailed. A number of years later, Amherst did abolish the fraternities. It’s an important lesson to me in my political life. Sometimes you begin a campaign knowing that in the next year, two years — while you’re actually there — you may not succeed, but sowing the seeds of discussion, debate, maybe in 5, sometimes 10, sometimes 15, 20 years, things turn out and you wind up winning the debate.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>And this:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Do you favor the deregulations of the current <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://new.yimbyaction.org/\" target=\"_blank\">YIMBY</a> movement — allow a lot more building?</p>\r\n<p><strong>STIGLITZ: </strong>No. That goes actually to one of the themes of my book. One of the themes in my book is, one person’s freedom is another person’s unfreedom. That means that what I can do . . . I talk about freedom as what somebody could do, his opportunity set, his choices that he could make. And when one person exerts an externality on another by exerting his freedom, he’s <em>constraining</em> the freedom of others.</p>\r\n<p>If you have unfettered building — for instance, you don’t have any zoning — you can have a building as high as you want. The problem is that your high building deprives another building of light. There may be noise. You don’t want your children exposed to, say, a brothel that is created next door. In the book, I actually talk about one example. Houston is a city with relatively little zoning, and I have some quotes from people living there, describing some of the challenges that that results in.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>And this;</p>\r\n<blockquote><p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Your <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://econpapers.repec.org/article/aeaaecrev/v_3a74_3ay_3a1984_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a433-44.htm\" target=\"_blank\">1984 piece with Carl Shapiro</a> on efficiency wage theory — looking back at that now, 40 years later, you think of that mainly as a contribution to understanding organizations, an explanation of unemployment, a claim about sticky wages? Or how do you frame that article? Because in the piece itself, the wage is actually flexible, at least the real wage is.</p></blockquote>\r\n<p>Recommended, interesting throughout.</p>\r\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/06/my-very-good-conversation-with-joseph-stiglitz.html\">My very good Conversation with Joseph Stiglitz</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com\">Marginal REVOLUTION</a>.</p>\r\n<img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/900147779/0/marginalrevolution\" />\r\n<div><a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/900147779/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/900147779/marginalrevolution,\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/900147779/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/x.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/900147779/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/900147779/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/06/my-very-good-conversation-with-joseph-stiglitz.html#comments\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/comments20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/06/my-very-good-conversation-with-joseph-stiglitz.html/feed\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/commentsrss20.png\" /></a> \r\n<div><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/06/my-very-good-conversation-with-joseph-stiglitz.html#comments\"><h3>Comments</h3></a><ul><li><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/06/my-very-good-conversation-with-joseph-stiglitz.html#comment-160773899\">In reply to rsm.
