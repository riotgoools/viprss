Had just listened to an Adam Curry podcast and one from the Gillmor Gang. Played a bit of music, described how a podcatcher would work, pretty close to the way they work today. Shortly after the feature would be in Radio UserLand. It was the only episode I did in August 2004. The next one is on September 1 and there are a total of nine shows in September, including the first <a href=\"http://secrets.scripting.com/\">Trade Secrets</a> which is a podcast Adam and I did together. Here's the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2004/08.html\">archive</a> for this blog in August 2004.","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"5d92719a8b413aeaeb57e2ae2cbdbb85055cf9f9edcda0546a24d2d93de0da68","category":"default"}
