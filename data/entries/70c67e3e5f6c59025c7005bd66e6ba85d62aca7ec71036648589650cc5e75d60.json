Down, down you go into the depths of the unconscious, dark and fertile with the terror and longing that make for suffering, the surrender that makes for the end of suffering, not in resignation but in faith. It is then that the still, small voice of the soul begins to sing; it is then that the trapdoor becomes a portal into a life larger, truer, and more possible — a kind of rebirth.</p>\n<p>Nobel laureate <strong>Louise Glück</strong> (April 22, 1943–October 13, 2023) captures the essence of such experiences, the way they sober us to being mortal and to being alive, with an image of piercing originality in the title poem of her 1992 collection <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Wild-Iris-Louise-Gluck/dp/0880013346/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>The Wild Iris</em></strong></a> (<a href=\"https://search.worldcat.org/title/24627896\" target=\"_blank\"><em>public library</em></a>).</p>\n<p></p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>THE WILD IRIS</strong><br />\n<em>by Louise Glück</em></p>\n<p>At the end of my suffering<br />\nthere was a door.</p>\n<p>Hear me out: that which you call death<br />\nI remember.</p>\n<p>Overhead, noises, branches of the pine shifting.<br />\nThen nothing. The weak sun<br />\nflickered over the dry surface.</p>\n<p>It is terrible to survive<br />\nas consciousness<br />\nburied in the dark earth.</p>\n<p>Then it was over: that which you fear, being<br />\na soul and unable<br />\nto speak, ending abruptly, the stiff earth<br />\nbending a little.  And what I took to be<br />\nbirds darting in low shrubs.</p>\n<p>You who do not remember<br />\npassage from the other world<br />\nI tell you I could speak again: whatever<br />\nreturns from oblivion returns<br />\nto find a voice:</p>\n<p>from the center of my life came<br />\na great fountain, deep blue<br />\nshadows on azure sea water.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Couple with Ursula K.
