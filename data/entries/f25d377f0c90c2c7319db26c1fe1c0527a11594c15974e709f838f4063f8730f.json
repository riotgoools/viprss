It doesn’t have to be actively not fun either, but the primary feeling should be that of effort. It should look a lot less like that “10 minute full body” workout from your local digital media creator and a lot more like a serious session at the gym. You want the mental equivalent of sweating. It’s not that the quickie doesn’t do anything, it’s just that it is wildly suboptimal if you actually care to learn.</p>\n</blockquote>","author":"","siteTitle":"micro.brad","siteHash":"27daae1c149c6ec5a964b1fe9266f5a58f96cfb4b36e39006f255c6b2b53a76d","entryHash":"f25d377f0c90c2c7319db26c1fe1c0527a11594c15974e709f838f4063f8730f","category":"Sites"}
