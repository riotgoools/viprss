Over the past five years, artists and activists have tried to get mainstream Big Country to get with the multiracial program, but they have won little more than nominal, marginal inclusion rather than a reckoning with the industry’s soul. However lovely, Chapman’s and Combs’s performance ties too neat a bow on years of conflict within country music over who gets to play with the genre’s big boys.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Contrast that with articles like this one: <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/02/tracy-chapman-luke-combs-fast-car-grammy-performance/677361/\">A Rare Moment Americans Could All Share</a>.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>People across an angry and divided nation were given a magical, unifying moment on Sunday. We needed it.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>“Ties too neat a bow” indeed. Maybe it’s the beginning of something but it sure doesn’t seem like the end of anything.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> If you’re on Bluesky, I recommend reading <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/tressiemcphd.bsky.social/post/3kktlkjbjcc25\">Cottom’s thread</a> that answers a few questions that readers had.</p>\n\n        \n\n <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Luke%20Combs\">Luke Combs</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/music\">music</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/racism\">racism</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Tracy%20Chapman\">Tracy Chapman</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Tressie%20McMillan%20Cottom\">Tressie McMillan Cottom</a></p>\n\n <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/02/the-unspoken-racial-politics-of-fast-car-at-the-grammys\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"774b2287cee0da226b434f38f1c7d72426415cc5849fdeefb96f77ed1aef37d7","category":"default"}
