Marsha Blackburn said last fall that the Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA) could do just what digital rights and LGBTQ+ advocates have been warning it would do: <a href=\"https://www.them.us/story/kosa-senator-blackburn-censor-trans-content\">censor trans content online</a>. (<a href=\"https://www.them.us/story/kosa-senator-blackburn-censor-trans-content\">Them</a>)</em></p><p>I’m traveling through Europe for the next two weeks on a long-awaited vacation, but happened to see that, once again, far right groups like the Heritage Foundation are <a href=\"https://x.com/evan_greer/status/1835815300283129949\">trying to jam</a> the very misleadingly named Kids Online Safety Act through the House. </p><p>I had <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TS1wax3KjnA&amp;t=13s\">top researcher danah boyd on </a><em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TS1wax3KjnA&amp;t=13s\">Power User</a></em> a couple months ago to talk about kids’ mental health and social media use (turns out the two aren’t as correlated as the media would have you believe!). I’ll also be dropping part two of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNxV4UMRYQA&amp;t=16s\">my YouTube series about the moral panic around kids and technology</a> in the coming weeks.</p><p>But Mike Masnick at TechDirt has been doing <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/search/?num=20&amp;q=kosa&amp;search=Search\">the best coverage</a> of this moral panic and the extremely dangerous legislation it has birthed. I wanted to highlight his recent piece, <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2024/09/18/house-looks-to-make-kosa-and-coppa-worse/\">which you should absolutely read in full</a>:</p><blockquote><p>If you had that Congress was going to take bad “protect the children” bills and make them worse on your bingo card, congratulations, you’ve won this week’s easiest prediction.</p><p>This seems like a not great situation. <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2024/09/17/kosa-rises-from-the-ashes-house-committee-announces-markup/\">As mentioned</a>, the House Energy &amp; Commerce Committee is holding a markup today for a bunch of bills. Yesterday, they revealed the <a href=\"https://docs.house.gov/Committee/Calendar/ByEvent.aspx?EventID=117432\">various amendments being proposed</a>, including three replacement bills (called Amendments in the Nature of a Substitute or “AINS”) for <a href=\"https://docs.house.gov/meetings/IF/IF00/20240918/117432/BILLS-118-HR7891-B001257-Amdt-9-U9.pdf\">KOSA</a>, <a href=\"https://docs.house.gov/meetings/IF/IF00/20240918/117432/BILLS-118-HR7890-A000370-Amdt-7-U6.pdf\">COPPA 2.0</a>, and <a href=\"https://docs.house.gov/meetings/IF/IF00/20240918/117432/BILLS-118-HR7890-P000034-Amdt-8-U8.pdf\">APRA</a>.</p><p>COPPA 2.0 is <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2023/05/04/another-day-another-nonsense-bill-from-congress-to-protect-the-children/\">another problematic</a> “protect the children bill” that takes the already problematic COPPA law and makes it way worse. In the Senate, the vote on KOSA (which was <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2024/07/30/senate-to-kids-well-listen-when-you-agree-with-us-on-kosa/\">approved 91 to 3</a>) was actually a merged version of KOSA and COPPA 2.0, referred to as KOSPA. So, what happens to both bills is important. The inclusion of APRA is a bit strange as it was an attempt at a comprehensive federal privacy bill that I thought was probably <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2024/04/23/any-privacy-law-is-going-to-require-some-compromise-is-apra-the-right-set-of-tradeoffs/\">about as good</a> as we might otherwise get, though it involved compromises. But it died a quick death as folks on both sides of the issue hated the compromises. I have no idea why anyone would bring it back now as it just didn’t have the votes.</p><p>The new versions of KOSA and COPPA 2.0, however, still <strong>do not fix the underlying problems of these bills</strong>, and in some ways appear to make them worse. </p><p><strong>The new version of KOSA adds in new language that will absolutely lead to abuse by Republicans to force companies to remove LGBTQ+ content.</strong></p><p>… It’s not hard to see how this could go very, very badly. Imagine an LGBTQ+ child who has not come out to their intolerant parents, but who has found communities online that are helpful to them. Parents can demand that internet platforms hand over all the info they provided to the platform. </p><p>Kids have privacy rights too, but not under this bill. The assumption here is that kids have no rights, that kids are the property of their parents, and that parents can get access to basically any content their kids access online, and even change the data on their kids.</p></blockquote><p>Read more about KOSA on <em><a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2024/09/16/heritage-foundation-admits-kosa-will-be-useful-for-removing-pro-abortion-content-if-trump-wins/\">TechDirt</a>. </em></p><div><div><div><p>Thanks for reading!
