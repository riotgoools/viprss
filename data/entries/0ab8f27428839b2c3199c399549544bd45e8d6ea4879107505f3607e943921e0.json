I didn’t know what to include here, so I just took the opening paragraphs…the rest of it is pretty intense.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>On March 6, 2020, Andrew and I went to a rave. If it weren’t for what happened later, I don’t think it would have stood out in my memory. A couple of days before, I had met a friend at the movie theatre at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, to see “Portrait of a Lady on Fire.” It was the first time I saw someone trying to open a door with his elbows. My friend and I ordered separate popcorns as a hygienic precaution. I remember someone behind us coughing, and being aware of it.</p>\n\n<p>On Friday night, before the party, I put a single drop of LSD into a glass of water. I drank half, and Andrew drank the other half. For the next couple of hours, while he made beats in his studio, I lay in bed with my eyes closed, listening to one of the final mixes made by Andrew Weatherall, a British d.j. who had got his start in the nineteen-eighties club scene and had recently died. The tracks had titles like “Jagged Mountain Melts at Dawn” and “The Descending Moonshine Dervishes.”</p>\n\n<p>I sat up in bed, and, as the waves of acid broke over me, I wrote down some thoughts. I was a magazine writer, but I was thinking of going to Brazil to write a book about the Amazon rain forest. The problem with trying to write a book about the Amazon rain forest was that it was a place that was much better left alone, like Everest, or the moon. I looked over at the cat, who was sitting on an ottoman, her eyes two glowing lamps of annoyance. It was time to go out.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>I read Witt’s first book, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0571331998/ref=nosim/0sil8\">Future Sex</a>, and really enjoyed it, so I’m looking forward to <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0593317645/ref=nosim/0sil8\">Health and Safety</a> (<a href=\"https://bookshop.org/a/2966/9780593317648\">Bookshop</a>).</p>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/books\">books</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Emily%20Witt\">Emily Witt</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Health%20and%20Safety\">Health and Safety</a></p>\n\n         <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/07/the-last-rave\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"0ab8f27428839b2c3199c399549544bd45e8d6ea4879107505f3607e943921e0","category":"default"}
