This editor supports them. </p>\n<p>And 100% built on WordPress. Why reinvent all the good stuff that's been debugged and scaled and has all that support in the world. As I like to say, one way of doing something is better than two, no matter how much better the second way is. </p>\n<p>PS: And don't forget about <a href=\"https://blogroll.social\">the blogroll</a>. It's part of the puzzle too.</p>\n<p>PPS: The house was really cold when I did this recording so I walked around to try to stay warm. By the end I was pretty close to shivering out loud. I turned the heat up after I finished. </p>","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"069a55f739e673f735b46078c7d102c80f64e36869e65440f9675e74c8ede8c5","category":"default"}
