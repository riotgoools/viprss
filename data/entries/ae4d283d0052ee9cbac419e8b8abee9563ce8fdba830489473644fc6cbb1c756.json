I wanted to use a heart to show that I liked the comment, but I’d already used the red heart and wanted to add a little more flair. Usually I just pick a pink one arbitrarily, but in that moment, I was like, WTF do all these little hearts actually mean? Do they have official meanings? Am I using them wrong? </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.emojipedia.org/what-every-heart-emoji-really-means/\">It’s</a> <a href=\"https://www.seventeen.com/life/tech-social-media/g43542479/heart-emoji-meanings/\">a</a> <a href=\"https://www.womenshealthmag.com/sex-and-love/g35382506/heart-emojis-meaning/\">common</a> <a href=\"https://later.com/emoji-meanings/hearts-and-objects/\">question</a>, and the answer seems to essentially be: “No, there are no official meanings,” although according to <a href=\"https://emojipedia.org/symbols\">Emojipedia</a> the hearts do at least have official names: growing heart, beating heart, and revolving hearts (to choose the three that were least obvious to me). </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/threehearts1.jpg\" srcset=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=500,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/threehearts1.jpg 500w, /cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/threehearts1.jpg 1200w\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"105\" alt=\"threehearts1.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>The revolving hearts were the most confusing, in my opinion. Why are they revolving? According to <a href=\"https://www.thepioneerwoman.com/just-for-fun/g46672582/heart-emoji-meanings/\">The Pioneer Woman</a>, they mean “falling in love, or deep affection.” That didn’t seem right, so I asked a few friends. </p>\n\n<ul><li>“Sending love?” my husband said. “I don’t know.” </li>\n<li>“Love,” a friend said. “But specifically between you and the person you’re sending it to. It’s like a step up from ❤️.”</li>\n<li>Another friend said something similar: “Like ❤️,” she wrote, “but 10% more girlie and romantic.”</li>\n<li>I asked Jason. “I would say there’s a strong feeling of being intertwined,” he said. “Like, I wouldn’t send that to a friend. I don’t think I have ever received that particular emoji from anyone.”</li>\n<li>“Ok, I’ve never used that particular one,” another friend echoed, “but I always use the two hearts 💕 instead of a red heart, because I think it’s cuter. I have no idea what 💞 means.”</li></ul>\n\n<p>Emojipedia leaves it open-ended in its <a href=\"https://emojipedia.org/revolving-hearts\">💞 emoji-descriptor</a>: “Hearts revolving around one or more other hearts.” (Around even <em>more</em> hearts?) In <a href=\"https://blog.emojipedia.org/what-every-heart-emoji-really-means/\">a 2020 post</a>, Emojipedia also acknowledged that “intrinsically each heart has no more coded meaning than what meets the eye.”</p>\n\n <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/emoji\">emoji</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/language\">language</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/texting\">texting</a></p>\n\n <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/03/what-do-the-different-emoji-hearts-mean\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Edith Zimmerman","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"ae4d283d0052ee9cbac419e8b8abee9563ce8fdba830489473644fc6cbb1c756","category":"default"}
