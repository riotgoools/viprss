{"title":"Liminarius adventures","link":"https://bradbarrish.com/2023/08/10/liminarius-adventures/","date":1691702594000,"content":"<p>I migrated an email newsletter I started a few months ago from Substack to Paragraph this week. Maybe I‚Äôll get into the reasons in another post, but the details aren‚Äôt all that important right now. In deciding to hop over to another platform, I needed to complicate it further by re-branding the newsletter. And in order to rebrand the newsletter, I needed to come up with a truly unique word. And not just any word, but a brand new word. A word that did not exist previously. And once I had that word, I needed to create a visual representation of that word. Then and only then could I send out a newsletter. All of this was decided on Monday evening and in the early hours of Tuesday, I did it. You can read more about it and subscribe at <a href=\"https://liminari.us/\">liminari.us</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I ended up posting an image I didn‚Äôt end up using as a reply to a thread on The Hell Site Formerly Known As Twitter.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<div><blockquote><p> <a href=\"https://t.co/d8fYdYdcf2\">pic.twitter.com/d8fYdYdcf2</a></p>‚Äî Brad Barrish (@bradbarrish) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bradbarrish/status/1688939328414896128?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 8, 2023</a></blockquote></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Then someone asked me to share my ‚Äúprocess‚Äù and I could not resist. I figured I would turn the thread into a post here. So, like I was saying, I had to come up with a new word, which is a thing I‚Äôve been doing a lot with ChatGPT and Claude lately. In this particular case, I used Claude. There‚Äôs no real reason I chose Claude over ChatGPT. Here‚Äôs the initial prompt:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre><code>Forget everything I have previously asked you. You have been a professional lexicographer for decades now and I have hired you to come up with some brand new words that help describe this unique in-between time that we are in where it feels like we are on the precipice of general artificial intelligence, but not quite there yet. Things feel impressive, but maybe not so intelligent. Please come up with some new words and describe the logic used to come up with them. Thank you!</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>It came up with some decent words, but one of the words it mentioned in the descriptions of a few of the words it created was liminal. Great word, especially given what‚Äôs happening in the world right now. I told Claude it was a great word and asked it to come up with some other words that use it. Here‚Äôs how it responded:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre><code>You're right, \"liminal\" is a great word to describe this transitional period. Here are a few more ideas using that root:\n\nLiminelligence (lim-in-tel-i-gence) - Intelligence in a liminal state, neither fully realized nor primitive. The limbo-like intelligence of AI systems that are progressing but not yet fully \"general.\"\n\nPreliminence (pree-lim-i-nence) - The quality of being preliminary yet showing glimpses of future prominence. The state of AI demonstrating potential without being fully eminent/dominant.\n\nProtoliminal (pro-toe-lim-in-al) - Being at the threshold of a new state, standing at the limen or transitional point between two phases. Describes AI as protoliminal to general intelligence.\n\nLiminct (lim-inkt) - On the cusp of instinct and intelligence. Having qualities of both instinctual reaction and thoughtful analysis. Describes AI as liminal between automated response and higher reasoning.\n\nLiminary (lim-in-air-ee) - Pertaining to the liminal state and phase of transition. Describes the liminary period in which AI currently exists between narrow and general capabilities.\n\nLet me know if these liminal-inspired words help capture that sense of being on the threshold! I'm happy to continue this creative brainstorming of new terms for you.</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Alright. Alright. Liminary is like a luminary! I riffed on it a bit to come up with the word liminarius. Then asked Claude to define this made-up word.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre><code>Nice, \"liminarius\" has a cool Latin vibe to it! Here's how I would define it as a new term:\n\nLiminarius (li-min-air-ee-us) - adjective - Possessing qualities characteristic of a liminal state or transitional period between two modes of being. Describes an entity navigating an in-between phase with qualities of what came before and hints of what is to come.\n\nSpecifically for AI, liminarius describes systems that exhibit some capabilities indicative of future general intelligence, while still reliant on features of narrow AI. Liminarius bots can impress yet still lack full autonomous reasoning. They are on the threshold, neither completely lacking in intelligence nor fully formed.\n\nA liminarius phase stands at a crossroads between past and future, drawing partially on old forms while pioneering new abilities. Liminarius intelligences walk the line between instinctive and conscious thought, automata and sapient beings. Their existence is defined by potential in the midst of transformation.\n\nIn summary, \"liminarius\" could serve as a useful and poetic adjective to characterize AI and technology progressing toward, but not yet realizing, greater possibilities. Let me know if this definition captures the essence of what you had in mind with this term!</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>So then I‚Äôm thinking, ‚ÄòMan, that‚Äôs a great new word we invented just now, Claude. Thank you! Now, f you‚Äôll excuse me, I need to talk to Midjourney about VISUALIZING this awesome new word.‚Äô So then I just started using bits and pieces of Claude‚Äôs definition as prompts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It‚Äôs worth mentioning that there are some insanely talented people and an incredible generative art community on The Hell Site Formerly Known As Twitter. Being able to see the prompts people are using to get the results they post really helps me and many others learn so I‚Äôm aways especially appreciative when others see the value in sharing their prompts. When I see stuff I like and the prompt is shared, I copy/paste it and a link to the attributed post into a note in Apple Notes. You can always tell when someone is sharing a prompt on a generative image by whether you see the ALT overlay in the lower left corner of the image. You can click/touch on the ALT text to reveal the prompt. It looks like this:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"787\" height=\"625\" src=\"https://bradbarrish.files.wordpress.com/2023/08/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-13.51.19.jpeg?w=787\" srcset=\"https://bradbarrish.files.wordpress.com/2023/08/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-13.51.19.jpeg 787w, https://bradbarrish.files.wordpress.com/2023/08/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-13.51.19.jpeg?w=150 150w, https://bradbarrish.files.wordpress.com/2023/08/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-13.51.19.jpeg?w=300 300w, https://bradbarrish.files.wordpress.com/2023/08/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-13.51.19.jpeg?w=768 768w\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So back to the image I posted‚Ä¶ I saw <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bradbarrish/status/1689532136821600256\">a great prompt from Nerbts</a> last week that I saved to Apple Notes.
