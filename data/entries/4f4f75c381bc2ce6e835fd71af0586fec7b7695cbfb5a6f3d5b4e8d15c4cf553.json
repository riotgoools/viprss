Here is one brief response I wrote: “Just keep on buying puts with a small pct. of your wealth. You don’t have to use leverage, though of course a real pessimist should. What is hard about shorting is that the world isn’t in fact going to end! You are smuggling in categories from very different contexts. And none of this requires anything remotely like a “strong version of market efficiency.” It does require that the end of world is bearish for prices at some point! [once people recognize doom might be coming, not when doom finally arrives]”</p>\r\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/10/effective-altruists-and-finance-theory.html\">Effective Altruists and finance theory</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com\">Marginal REVOLUTION</a>.</p>\r\n<img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/906989318/0/marginalrevolution\" />\r\n<div><a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/906989318/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/906989318/marginalrevolution,\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/906989318/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/x.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/906989318/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/906989318/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/10/effective-altruists-and-finance-theory.html#comments\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/comments20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/10/effective-altruists-and-finance-theory.html/feed\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/commentsrss20.png\" /></a> \r\n<div><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/10/effective-altruists-and-finance-theory.html#comments\"><h3>Comments</h3></a><ul><li><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/10/effective-altruists-and-finance-theory.html#comment-160827801\">In reply to Student.
