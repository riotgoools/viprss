{"title":"Mute, Block, Breathe: How to deal with (un)Social Media","link":"https://om.co/2024/11/10/mute-block-breathe-how-to-deal-with-unsocial-media/","date":1731260813000,"content":"<p>Scott Belsky, Adobe’s chief product officer, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://om.co/2020/05/06/stuckom-with-scott-belsky/\">said something</a> in a 2020 conversation that has stuck with me since.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Twitter is one of those products where I can see overuse making people have a long term, problem with the product emotionally. And that’s being exacerbated in the day we’re living in now.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>You can extend this to almost all social media, which has become quite unsocial these days. I have been well aware of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://om.co/2020/07/06/conflict-culture-is-making-social-unsocial/\">the rise of conflict culture</a> for over half a decade. It has allowed me to prepare for the detrimental impact on social platforms for a while now. As result, I am better prepared to exert a modicum of control over what comes into my feeds. In addition to limiting my personal exposure to Twitter, Threads, and other social media to less than a couple of hours a week, I have created a series of rules for myself to eliminate any concept of <em>“angertainment”</em> that has become standard on social platforms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These allow me to avoid people and accounts that are engagement farming and instead focus on higher-value signals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My social media rule No. 1 for our present rancor-filled times is that I will mute any account (a person or a media outlet) that I think is creating more heat than light.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I asked the question to my followers on <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.threads.net/@om/post/DCKQp6my_N4?xmt=AQGzQAc41KPhL8fQoKPah_07O3hrqmtwkuBYHGuVISPEfg\">Threads,</a> and here are a couple of replies that stood out. I will keep updating the list as more replies come through.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Block. Hard block. I will also report anyone I think is causing stuff, being cruel or similar. After being on Twitter and FB from fairly early on I am much more selective about who I follow here. I’ve learned. I’m here for my own reasons, I try and be positive, informative and welcoming, but if folks wreck the vibe they go bye bye. <a href=\"https://www.threads.net/@michaelrennick/post/DCKcgjrpZ6b?xmt=AQGzC6-LEKrxGysSzj-fJsC3zbnAAuGxsGssnTKRvcoRtA\" target=\"_blank\">Michael Rennick </a></li>\n\n\n\n<li>I will resist replying to or reposting armchair quarterbacks. Will be more mindfully focusing on things other than the current election, like sports, tech, product, data/analytics, etc. <a href=\"https://www.threads.net/@theromit/post/DCKz_0nSNDb?xmt=AQGzizbrEuZu0SNHJ4rTDU0v5z8P-QroPYhjt70hIb8i8w\" target=\"_blank\">Romit Mehta</a> </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Wait 60 seconds before responding. Drafts are great. Blog posts are better. <a href=\"https://www.threads.net/@joshuanguyen/post/DCKWXg9ywD3?xmt=AQGzwots2NyegAmokQKkQu8ttn4Oum2JrsjIKYCwNov7rQ\" target=\"_blank\">Josh Nguyen</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li>I mute if you’re just being stupid. I’m tired of stupid. Instant block if you’re spreading hate, racism etc. <a href=\"https://www.threads.net/@jmeister_design/post/DCKhtGuyQ9Y?xmt=AQGzIWBxI0xiaYtT8sVsOv0C3cxxVtkRC3s4WYznSBYslg\">JMesiter Design</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>More Context with Essays from My Archives</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><a href=\"https://om.co/2023/10/15/social-internet-is-dead-get-used-to-it/\">Social Internet Is Dead.
