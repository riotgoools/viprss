Here's one thing for the list. When I go to Google and search for NBB, it should take me to <a href=\"http://scripting.com/stories/2009/11/24/naturalbornBlogger.html\">this page</a> on my blog. It shouldn't even require me to click on Feelin Lucky. That's the problem with Google. It's had a million years to get to know me, and it still thinks I might mean <a href=\"https://nbbank.com/\">National Bank of Blacksburg</a>. Google is clueless compared to what I've become accustomed to with ChatGPT. They and everyone else are completely missing the boat here. Folks, <a href=\"http://scripting.com/\">this</a> is my blog, read it and use it when I ask a question. Also they don't have to even read my blog, <a href=\"http://scripting.com/stories/2009/11/24/naturalbornBlogger.html\">NBB</a> is defined in my <a href=\"http://scripting.com/publicfolder/misc/glossary.opml\">glossary</a>, which I make public and is used in rendering all my pages.","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"0e56430b71e1f4bdca9b58db42a4510cac9706972b22282313694b40c77d5189","category":"Sites"}
