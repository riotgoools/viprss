Now I don’t need to make that anymore.”\n</p><p>\nOr you could do something about that jealous pain.\nShut off your phone, kill the distractions, make it top priority, and spend the time.\n</p><p>\nIt takes many hours to make what you want to make.\n<strong>\nThe hours don’t suddenly appear.\nYou have to steal them from comfort.\n</strong>\nWhatever you were doing before was comfortable.\nThis is not.\nThis will be <em>really</em> uncomfortable.\n</p><p>\nThe few times in my life I’ve made a real change like this, it felt <strong>awful</strong> on the surface.\nI wasn’t shallow-happy about it.\nI wasn’t smiling.\nI was annoyed and fighting it inside, but on the outside I did the work.\nAnd in the end, got the deeper satisfaction of finishing.\n</p>","author":"Derek Sivers","siteTitle":"Derek Sivers","siteHash":"4098504c0d0759e13901f29e63f7d7dbb1d972a078c6dc4560660f373da5c25e","entryHash":"f9d535ff2e2b269cc60bff47df741062756b583aadf6b4e854bae12a757b95c1","category":"default"}
