It doesn‚Äôt reveal much but I am excited to watch the new season! (No spoilers please from folks who have read <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3Nq5lig\">the books</a>.)</p>\n\n<p>These solidly middlebrow shows like Silo, The Diplomat, and The Gilded Age are some of my favorites to watch these days because they are well-produced with quality actors but don‚Äôt tax the viewer (ok, me‚Ä¶they don‚Äôt tax me) as much as more serious fare like Sh≈çgun, My Brilliant Friend, Severance, or Chernobyl (all of which I love to bits but sometimes feels like eating your vegetables, if you know what I mean). But a good media diet is a varied media diet and stuff like Silo is really hitting the spot for me right now.</p>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Silo\">Silo</a> ¬∑ <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/trailers\">trailers</a> ¬∑ <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/TV\">TV</a> ¬∑ <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/video\">video</a></p>\n\n         <p>üí¨ <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/10/season-two-of-silo\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> ‚Üí</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"4cf6d579f65d88f1f62d98c26ccc6dcbbc8abea8e2bd5c93ae401e9215241bdb","category":"Sites"}
