Brian Winter has been studying and writing about Latin America for over 20 years. He’s been tracking the struggles and triumphs of the region as it’s dealt with decades of coups, violence, and shifting economics. His work offers a nuanced perspective on Latin America’s persistent challenges and remarkable resilience.</p>\r\n<p>Together Brian and Tyler discuss the politics and economics of nearly every country from the equator down. They cover the future of migration into Brazil, what it’s doing right in agriculture, the cultural shift in race politics, crime in Rio and São Paulo, the effectiveness and future consequences of Bukele’s police state in El Salvador, the economic growth of Columbia despite continued violence, the prevalence of startups and psychoanalysis in Argentina, Uruguay’s reduction in poverty levels, the beautiful ugliness of Sao Paulo, where Brian will explore next, and more.</p></blockquote>\r\n<p>And here is one excerpt;</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>What’s the economic geography of Brazil going to look like? All the wealth near <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://peoplefoodandnature.org/landscape/mato-grosso-brazil/\" target=\"_blank\">Mato Grosso</a> and the north just very, very poor? Or the north empties out? How’s that going to work? There used to be <em>some</em> modest degree of balance.</p>\r\n<p><strong>WINTER: </strong>That’s true. Most of the population in Brazil and the economic center, for sure, was in the southeast. That means, really, São Paulo state, which is about a quarter of Brazil’s population but roughly a third of its GDP. Rio as well, and the state of <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.britannica.com/place/Minas-Gerais\" target=\"_blank\">Minas Gerais</a>, which has a name that tells its history. That means “general mines” in Portuguese. That’s the area where a lot of the gold came out of in the 18th and 19th centuries. That’s gone now, so it’s not as much of an economic pull.</p>\r\n<p>You’re right, Tyler, though, that a lot of the real boom right now, the action, is in places like Mato Grosso, which is in the region of Brazil called the Central West. That’s soy country. I’m from Texas, and Mato Grosso is virtually indistinguishable from Texas these days. It’s hot. It’s flat. The crop, like I said, is soy. There’s cattle ranching as well.</p>\r\n<p>Even the music — Brazil, as others have noted, has gone from being the country of bossa nova and the samba in the 1970s to being the country of <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4YodH6tEcQ&amp;list=PL_Q15fKxrBb5r3VmBvh7TVNMLx_F1sxfa&amp;index=4\" target=\"_blank\">sertanejo</a> today. Sertanejo is a Brazilian cousin of country music with accordions, but it’s sung by people — men mostly — in jeans, big belt buckles, and cowboy hats. They’re importing that — not only that economic model but that lifestyle as well.</p>\r\n<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>What is the great Brazilian music of today? <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BAsica_popular_brasileira\" target=\"_blank\">MPB</a> is dead, right? So, what should someone listen to?</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Recommended, interesting throughout.</p>\r\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/07/my-excellent-conversation-with-brian-winter.html\">My excellent Conversation with Brian Winter</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com\">Marginal REVOLUTION</a>.</p>\r\n<img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/900988070/0/marginalrevolution\" />\r\n<div><a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/900988070/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/900988070/marginalrevolution,\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/900988070/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/x.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/900988070/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/900988070/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/07/my-excellent-conversation-with-brian-winter.html#comments\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/comments20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/07/my-excellent-conversation-with-brian-winter.html/feed\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/commentsrss20.png\" /></a> \r\n<div><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/07/my-excellent-conversation-with-brian-winter.html#comments\"><h3>Comments</h3></a><ul><li><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/07/my-excellent-conversation-with-brian-winter.html#comment-160780190\">In reply to Ben P.
