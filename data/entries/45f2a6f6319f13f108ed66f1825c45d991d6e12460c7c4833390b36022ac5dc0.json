The other person isn’t backing down.”\nThey raise their bid to $100, so as not to be the second-highest bidder and lose it all.\n</p><p>\nBut now the person offering $99 raises their bid to $101.\nBetter to lose only $1 than $99, right?\nSoon they’re offering me well over $100 to buy a $100 bill, just hoping the other person quits first.\n</p><p>\nThe real problem was not thinking it through in advance.\n</p><p>\nWhen the game starts, it’s easy to think short-term and say, “Ooh! Good deal!”\nThen when it’s too late, you slowly realize, “Uh-oh. What have I done?”\n</p><p>\nA lot of people get into bad life situations this way.\nA homeowner buys a house at the top end of their budget.\nA romantic falls for someone who’s already in a relationship.\nLater they complain about how they’re so in debt, or their sweetheart is cheating.\n</p><p>\n<strong>\nBefore you start something, think of the ways it could end.\n</strong>\nSometimes the smart choice is to say no to the whole game.\n</p>","author":"Derek Sivers","siteTitle":"Derek Sivers","siteHash":"4098504c0d0759e13901f29e63f7d7dbb1d972a078c6dc4560660f373da5c25e","entryHash":"45f2a6f6319f13f108ed66f1825c45d991d6e12460c7c4833390b36022ac5dc0","category":"default"}
