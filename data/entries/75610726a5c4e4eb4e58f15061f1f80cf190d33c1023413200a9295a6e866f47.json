Some revelations: Even discussing how to vote isn’t safe, prominent liberal Instagram accounts’ audiences are plummeting since Meta rolled out its restrictions, and Meta has complete control over three of the most widely used tools for self-expression.</p><p>As Drew Harwell <a href=\"https://www.threads.net/@drewharwell/post/DBL53oAuoE8\">posted</a>, “Secretly suppressing posts with the word \"v o t e\" in them during an election year is completely insane.”</p><p>Unfortunately, Meta has engaged in this type of overly aggressive content moderation for years. The company <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/09/11/threads-covid-coronavirus-searches-blocked/\">wholesale blocked searches</a> for vaccines and Long Covid for months during one of the deadliest waves of the pandemic, and still currently downranks that content, directly endangering public health. </p><p>Meta claims it’s doing all of this to stay out of politics, but these decisions have a massive impact on our political landscape. </p><p>“Meta’s decision to artificially limit the reach of political content on Threads, [Instagram, and Facebook] is itself a POLITICAL decision,” Judd Legum <a href=\"https://www.threads.net/@realjuddlegum/post/C3IjqwlOI-O\">posted last year</a>. “It privileges those who benefit from the political status quo by suppressing information that could disrupt the status quo while elevating entertainment, sports and other topics that do not threaten the powerful.”</p><p>Meta deems any content that discusses social justice or identity (things like LGBTQ rights, reproductive justice, etc) as “political”. The company says it will restrict any image, video, or text post that “identifies a problem that impacts people and is caused by the action or inaction of others,” which is an incredibly wide swath of content. If you speak about these things on Meta, your reach will be limited and your account will be surfaced to fewer people.</p><p>Meta’s undue restrictions on “political” content matter because social media has a profound impact on how people understand their communities and the world. One in five Americans <a href=\"https://archive.ph/l6b3G\">regularly gets their news from Instagram</a> — more than TikTok, X or Reddit.</p><div><figure><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa155e6fe-0425-45f6-9b49-3a555b0c1923_1152x884.png\"><div><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa155e6fe-0425-45f6-9b49-3a555b0c1923_1152x884.png\" width=\"408\" height=\"313.0833333333333\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa155e6fe-0425-45f6-9b49-3a555b0c1923_1152x884.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa155e6fe-0425-45f6-9b49-3a555b0c1923_1152x884.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa155e6fe-0425-45f6-9b49-3a555b0c1923_1152x884.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa155e6fe-0425-45f6-9b49-3a555b0c1923_1152x884.png 1456w\" /><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Meta’s actions, Geoff writes “could leave swaths of Americans wondering why we aren’t hearing as much about the election. And less likely to vote, too.” </p><p>I think it’s incredibly ironic that we’re set to ban TikTok over, in part, completely unproven allegations that it was warping political discussions (again, with no evidence) yet here we have one of the largest social media behemoths in America heavily manipulating people’s access to crucial information about things like voting, and there’s zero outcry or action from lawmakers. </p><h3>Watch this extremely good talk</h3><p>I had the pleasure of witnessing this 19 minute talk by Cabel Sasser of Panic, an app development company, live at XOXO this summer and it’s legitimately wonderful. It’s about life, art, and what it means to leave a legacy as a creative. Also, McDonalds. </p><p>Every minute of the speech is worth it, especially if you’re someone who does any sort of creative work. </p><div><div></div></div><h4>Forbes announces its inaugural Creator Upfronts</h4><p>Forbes is launching <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbes-spotlights/2024/10/10/forbes-first-ever-creator-upfronts-to-showcase-those-driving-the-creator-economy/\">its own “upfronts” event</a> specifically geared toward creators. As <span></span> notes, it's basically an opportunity for creators and marketers to get in a room together and forge ad partnerships. Kind of similar to how the TV upfronts allow broadcast networks to pitch advertisers on their upcoming shows, but the whole thing is sponsored by Walmart. </p><p>Forbes doesn’t have the best track record on this stuff. Two years ago they launched their Top Creators list, but the media company made the event inaccessible for disabled creators, which (while I assume was unintentional) was not a good look. Overall, the outlet doesn’t cover the creator world <em>too</em> much, but I hope that will change. There are some really great journalists at Forbes! I think it’s a good sign they’re thinking about the space. We’ll see if this latest event is inclusive and accessible for all types of creators or just a handful of A listers. </p><h4>A deep dive on Russell Brand’s magical amulet</h4><div><div><a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@airestech/video/7412681122267581738\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_640,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7fc86457-2847-4971-a1c0-fc89c03a3ede_1080x1920.jpeg\" loading=\"lazy\" /></a><div><a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@airestech\" target=\"_blank\">@airestech</a><a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@airestech/video/7412681122267581738\" target=\"_blank\">Russell Brand called it a 'Magic Amulet'... should we officially rename the Lifetune Flex? 🤔✨ What do you think?  #LifetuneFlex #MagicAmulet #RussellBrand</a></div></div><div><div><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com//img/alert-circle.svg\" loading=\"lazy\" />Tiktok failed to load.<br /><br />Enable 3rd party cookies or use another browser</div></div></div><p>Russell Brand is selling a new <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/callumbooth/2024/10/16/the-internet-is-angry-about-russell-brands-magical-amulet-heres-why/\">evil-repelling magical amulet</a> after converting to hardcore christianity.
