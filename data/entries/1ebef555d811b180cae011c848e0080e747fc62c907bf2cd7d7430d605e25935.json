But I missed it here and am glad to be back. Here are a few things I enjoyed while I was gone: </p>\n\n<p>1. <a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/article/best-childrens-books-written-by-celebrities.html\">Emily Gould’s ranking of 15 recent children’s books written by celebrities</a>, in The Cut. For instance, No. 15 (lowest):</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>Finally, it’s here, the book everyone has been clamoring for: woke retellings of Aesop’s fables, by Oscar-winning actress Natalie Portman! In Portman’s version of “The Three Little Pigs,” the first two pigs unwisely build their houses out of fast-food leftovers and plastic drinking straws. The wolf blows their houses down to warn them that only sustainable, environmentally friendly building practices are acceptable.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Lol.</p>\n\n<p>2. This little half factoid, teased on the <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/C7M_JVvJaj0/\">Iowa Quilt Museum’s Instagram</a>: “The Double Wedding Ring is one of the most unfinished patterns in American history.” But why? Broken engagements? Is the design too ambitious? I can confirm that it was difficult even to draw.</p>\n\n<p>3. <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2024/05/16/misunderstood-emojis-2024\">The Most Misunderstood Emojis of 2024</a>, in Axios. The <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/03/what-do-the-different-emoji-hearts-mean\">revolving hearts</a> don’t make the list, but maybe we cracked the code on those. 💞</p>\n\n<p>4. “As was the case with alcohol, my first and last thoughts of the day are usually Scrabble related.” <a href=\"https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2024/05/15/scrabble-anonymous/\">Brad Phillips’ essay in the Paris Review about swapping one addiction for another</a>. “Editing this essay today, on six different occasions I’ve stopped to open ISC.RO [and play Scrabble]. Each time, I’ve played more games than I’d intended.” Also: “A common obsession is a powerful unifier, one that renders all other biographical information meaningless.” </p>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/addiction\">addiction</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/books\">books</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/emoji\">emoji</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/quilts\">quilts</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Scrabble\">Scrabble</a></p>\n\n         <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/05/last-weeks-reads\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Edith Zimmerman","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"1ebef555d811b180cae011c848e0080e747fc62c907bf2cd7d7430d605e25935","category":"default"}
