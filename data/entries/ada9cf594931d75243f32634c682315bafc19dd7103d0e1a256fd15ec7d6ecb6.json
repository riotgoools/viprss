{"title":"[RIDGELINE] The Walk and Talk: Everything We Know","link":"https://craigmod.com/ridgeline/176/","date":1703462400000,"content":"Happy holidays, walkers!\nKevin Kelly and I began talking while walking together some twelve years ago, near his home in Pacifica. Eventually, we branched out, and for these past six years have been running more “formalized” walk-and-talks across five countries with some 40+ people. We’ve walked-and-talked in China, Spain, England, Japan, and Thailand. These experiences are some of the best weeks of our lives.\nWe’d love for you to be running walk-and-talks as well!","author":"","siteTitle":"Craig Mod","siteHash":"7358923c3192bccfb6b9f0032f475bef5140f12de0f235c80ca3d98e1a3d393b","entryHash":"ada9cf594931d75243f32634c682315bafc19dd7103d0e1a256fd15ec7d6ecb6","category":"Sites"}
