Statistics on school attendance by sex indicates that, in contrast to former slaves in the Southern United States, for whom serfs in Russia rarely sent their daughters to school during the 1860s and 1870s, regarding it as a waste of time that would fill their heads with needless knowledge and make them less fit for their feminine duties. The evidence is consistent and overwhelming. Among African Americans in the Southern United States, girls were at least as likely as boys to attend school: the Freedmen’s Bureau Consolidated Monthly School Report for June 1867, for example, listed 45,855 male and 52,981 female pupils in the schools that it monitored throughout the South; in almost every state, female pupils outnumbered male pupils and there were slightly more males than females. The decennial census returns showed a similar pattern between 1870 and 1910: school enrollment rates in the United States for Black children aged five to nineteen (the great majority of whom lived in the South) were fairly evenly balanced between the sexes, with female rates slightly higher than male in four of the five census years. (The male rate was slightly higher than the female in 1880.)</p></blockquote>\r\n<p>You can buy the book <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.amazon.com/Emancipation-Abolition-Aftermath-American-Slavery/dp/0300273665/ref=sr_1_1?crid=GINKE9ZGINQW&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.ThcV6fai55uTv3MI_thKlCrxqwy-s5An25d6mbC8NhYHphTAcr2nRq3w3Yps3g4RkjYneoMGxcWcRUgHIcqP5w.q5cZFYb8LOQe-GhutKoLHM08-xyUyTCdjYR4rsBr5uU&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=peter+kolchin+emancipation&amp;qid=1727573364&amp;sprefix=peter+kolchin%2Caps%2C92&amp;sr=8-1\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\r\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/09/emancipation.html\">*Emancipation*</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com\">Marginal REVOLUTION</a>.</p>\r\n<img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/905387033/0/marginalrevolution\" />\r\n<div><a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/905387033/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/905387033/marginalrevolution,\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/905387033/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/x.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/905387033/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/905387033/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/09/emancipation.html#comments\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/comments20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/09/emancipation.html/feed\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/commentsrss20.png\" /></a> \r\n<div><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/09/emancipation.html#comments\"><h3>Comments</h3></a><ul><li><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/09/emancipation.html#comment-160817445\">So amusing that people think this is about the 19th century, ...</a> <i>by Exactly right</i></li><li><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/09/emancipation.html#comment-160817444\">I like how nobody takes about Hawaiian slavery which remained ...</a> <i>by Peter</i></li><li><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/09/emancipation.html#comment-160817439\">Tempting to purchase, but the price needs to come down.Maybe, ...</a> <i>by Tom</i></li><li><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/09/emancipation.html#comment-160817436\">In reply to rayward.
