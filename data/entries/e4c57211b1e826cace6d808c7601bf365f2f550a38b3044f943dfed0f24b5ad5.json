Last week, Eilish played a proper set at the actual office. From the videoâ€™s description:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>Saudade is a Portuguese word that can be roughly defined as a feeling of melancholy, nostalgia or yearning for something that is beloved but not present. Thereâ€™s no perfect translation, but one of the closest English expressions of the word Iâ€™ve ever seen is Billie Eilishâ€™s Tiny Desk performance.</p>\n\n<p>Youâ€™d think the Los Angeles-born singer invented the term. Every breath is so full of indulgent melancholy, hopeful regret, at 22 years old sheâ€™s become a captivating fixture of what it means, or rather what it feels, to love and lose simultaneously.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Accompanied by a small band and her brother Finneas, Eilish played The Greatest, Lâ€™Amour de Ma Vie, i love you, and Birds of a Feather. Lovely.</p>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Billie%20Eilish\">Billie Eilish</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/music\">music</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Tiny%20Desk%20Concerts\">Tiny Desk Concerts</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/video\">video</a></p>\n\n         <p>ðŸ’¬ <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/12/billie-eilishs-tiny-desk-concert\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> â†’</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"e4c57211b1e826cace6d808c7601bf365f2f550a38b3044f943dfed0f24b5ad5","category":"Sites"}
