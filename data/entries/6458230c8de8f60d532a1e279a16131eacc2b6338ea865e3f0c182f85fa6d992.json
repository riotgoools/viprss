{"title":"Go Back Home, Your Mother Made You Waffles","link":"https://kottke.org/24/12/go-back-home-your-mother-made-you-waffles","date":1734127906000,"content":"\n        <p><a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/adamcsharp.bsky.social/post/3l5jvpckonv2t\">Adam Sharp has curated</a> the most flamboyant ways to tell someone to pound sand in other languages, and it’s delightful. There’s “go ski into a spruce” from Finland, in Brazil you tell someone to “go pick little coconuts,” while in Poland you say “go to the park and paint the ceiling.”</p>\n\n<p>The most devastating in the entire thread, though, is the French saying, “go back home, your mother made you waffles.” If someone said this to me, they would need a dustpan to sweep up the dust of me. If someone said this to me, they’d have to put in the newspaper I wasn’t mad. If someone said this to me, I’d think about the time my 5th grade teacher goaded the entire class to laugh at me because she was wrong about Berlin being on the border between East and West Germany, but I was right! If someone said this to me, all the liquid in my body would heat to one thousand degrees and my skin would melt. If someone said this to me, I’d move away and change my name and miss my family. If someone said this to me, the yellowjackets inside my chest would chew their way out and then sting ME for making them chew through bones. If someone said this to me, all of the songs I’ve heard plus all of the songs I haven’t would play at once inside my brain resulting in a symphony of anguish. If someone said this to me, I would go into debt buying a yacht hoping a gang of orcas wearing dead salmon on their heads would sink it.</p>\n\n<p>Seven benign words on their own collocated into a soul-destroying eviscerator punctuated by a normally pleasant breakfast item. I told the <a href=\"https://www.chrispiascik.com\">very tall Chris Piasick</a> about this saying and he drew it.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/mother-waffles.jpg\" srcset=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=500,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/mother-waffles.jpg 500w, /cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/mother-waffles.jpg 1200w\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1300\" height=\"1300\" alt=\"Go Back Home, Your Mother Made You Waffles\" /></p>\n\n<p>I’m sure there are science or moral reasons I shouldn’t use Jason’s “<a href=\"https://kottke.org/09/10/the-worlds-best-pancake-recipe\">World’s Best Pancake Recipe</a>” in my waffle maker, but I don’t care, I’ve been doing it for years and the resulting waffles are fabulous.</p>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Adam%20Sharp\">Adam Sharp</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Chris%20Piascik\">Chris Piascik</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/illustration\">illustration</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/typography\">typography</a></p>\n\n         <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/12/go-back-home-your-mother-made-you-waffles\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Aaron Cohen","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"6458230c8de8f60d532a1e279a16131eacc2b6338ea865e3f0c182f85fa6d992","category":"Sites"}
