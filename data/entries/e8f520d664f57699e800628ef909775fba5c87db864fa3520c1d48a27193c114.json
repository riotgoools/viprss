Isn’t Going to Make Art</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>It is very easy to get ChatGPT to emit a series of words such as “I am happy to see you.” There are many things we don’t understand about how large language models work, but one thing we can be sure of is that ChatGPT is not happy to see you. A dog can communicate that it is happy to see you, and so can a prelinguistic child, even though both lack the capability to use words. ChatGPT feels nothing and desires nothing, and this lack of intention is why ChatGPT is not actually using language. What makes the words “I’m happy to see you” a linguistic utterance is not that the sequence of text tokens that it is made up of are well formed; what makes it a linguistic utterance is the intention to communicate something.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>In the past few years, Chiang has written often about the limitations of LLMs — <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Ted%20Chiang\">you can read more about his AI views on kottke.org</a>.</p>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/art\">art</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/artificial%20intelligence\">artificial intelligence</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Ted%20Chiang\">Ted Chiang</a></p>\n\n         <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/09/can-ai-make-art\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"e8f520d664f57699e800628ef909775fba5c87db864fa3520c1d48a27193c114","category":"Sites"}
