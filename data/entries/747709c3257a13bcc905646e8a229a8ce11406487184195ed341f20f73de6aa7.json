This blogroll is much like the one I had in the 00s, but it's in motion, and it's a source of ideas. And it's doing the thing that Twitter used to do, it lets me have a way to see what specific people are interested in. I expect more of that as new people get this kind of blogroll. Right now I'm pretty much the only one. That should change soon. The next step is getting the blogroll running in WordPress. And then getting it running on Om's blog and Doc's blog, both of whom have real experience with the art of blogrolling. From that, I expect to have a better idea of what the UI should look like for people creating and managing these blogrolls. We'll iterate until it's pretty easy to set up and manage one.","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"747709c3257a13bcc905646e8a229a8ce11406487184195ed341f20f73de6aa7","category":"default"}
