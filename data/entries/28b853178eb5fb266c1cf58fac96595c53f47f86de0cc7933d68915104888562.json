In theory, nothing. <strong>It is a relationship that consists almost entirely in shared history, loyalty, and an ongoing pleasure in each other’s company.</strong> <strong>Friendship asks only that you be yourself</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In philosophical treatments of friendship, it can often be elevated to the highest form of human relationships, even if its perfect form is rare. In <em>The Metaphysics of Morals</em>, <a href=\"https://laphamsquarterly.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=8be778c42e715e178d4dca04e&amp;id=d036abeec1&amp;e=2f817a6f1e\">Immanuel Kant</a> compares the <strong>true friend to a black swan: something that “actually exists here and there” but which you don’t see every day</strong>, or perhaps ever in your lifetime! ….</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When <strong>friendship exists in the background</strong>, <strong>it’s unremarkable</strong> but generally <strong>uncomplicated</strong>.
