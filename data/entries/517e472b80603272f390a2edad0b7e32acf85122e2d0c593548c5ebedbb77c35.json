We donâ€™t know how much meaning they convey, but we do know that theyâ€™ll be very difficult to decode. Project CETIâ€™s scientists will need to observe the whales for years and achieve fundamental breakthroughs in AI. But if theyâ€™re successful, humans could be able to initiate a conversation with whales.</p>\n\n<p>This would be a first-contact scenario involving two species that have lived side by side for ages. I wanted to imagine how it could unfold. I reached out to marine biologists, field scientists who specialize in whales, paleontologists, professors of animal-rights law, linguists, and philosophers. Assume that Project CETI works, I told them. Assume that we are able to communicate something of substance to the sperm whale civilization. What should we say?</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>One of the worries about whale/human communication is the potential harm a conversation might cause.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>Cesar Rodriguez-Garavito, a law professor at NYU who is advising Project CETI, told me that whatever we say, we must avoid harming the whales, and that we shouldnâ€™t be too confident about our ability to predict the harms that a conversation could cause.</p>\n\n<p>The sperm whales may not want to talk. They, like us, can be standoffish even toward members of their own species-and we are much more distant relations. Epochs have passed since our last common ancestor roamed the Earth. In the interim, we have pursued radically different, even alien, lifeways.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Really interesting article.</p>\n\n <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/artificial%20intelligence\">artificial intelligence</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/language\">language</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Ross%20Andersen\">Ross Andersen</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/whales\">whales</a></p>\n\n <p>ðŸ’¬ <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/02/how-first-contact-with-whale-civilization-could-unfold\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> â†’</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"517e472b80603272f390a2edad0b7e32acf85122e2d0c593548c5ebedbb77c35","category":"default"}
