This is the first in an interview series in which I talk to people about their media diets and habits. Jason seemed like a good person to start with as we figure out the format, although honestly his actual <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/media%20diet\">Media Diet series</a> is more thorough. Look for the next installment in a few weeks!</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>So, have you seen or read anything good recently?</strong><br />\nI saw Dune Two on opening weekend. And I went by myself, which I like to do. There are no IMAX screens in Vermont, but there’s a theater about 45 minutes from me with a screen called the <a href=\"https://www.essexcinemas.com/\">T-Rex</a>. It’s not quite IMAX, but it’s not bad either.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/dune1copy.jpg\" srcset=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=500,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/dune1copy.jpg 500w, /cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/dune1copy.jpg 1200w\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"998\" height=\"1009\" alt=\"dune1copy.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p><strong>How was it?</strong><br />\nGreat. Better than the first one.</p>\n\n<p>And it was definitely a movie that you want to see on the big screen. Like you could feel the bass, and at one particular moment it felt like the whole theater was vibrating.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>I’m sure you’ve read Dune. Have you read it many times?</strong><br />\nI have not read <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0441172717/ref=nosim/0sil8\">Dune</a>, ever. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Really?!</strong><br />\nI’m not sure the movie necessarily makes me want to read Dune, either, which is surprising, because usually when I see a movie based on a book, I’ll be like, “Oh I need to read that.” Like when I saw Oppenheimer, later I read the book it’s based on, which is this <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0375726268/ref=nosim/0sil8\">600-page biography of Robert Oppenheimer</a>. And it was good, but I think the movie was better.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/jkap.jpeg\" srcset=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=500,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/jkap.jpeg 500w, /cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/jkap.jpeg 1200w\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1284\" alt=\"jkap.jpeg\" /></p>\n\n<p><strong>You mentioned the other day that you haven’t been enjoying, or even reading, many books recently. Is that true?</strong><br />\nPretty much? For the last couple months, I’ve been working a lot, and that means spending a lot of time on a device – my computer, my phone. And generally I don’t want to read after I’ve been working a lot. TV is much more something I turn to. Also video games. Like I play Fortnite, which is something I started doing with my kids, but now I play more than they do, which is weird. </p>\n\n<p><strong>And so you’re playing against other strangers on the Internet?</strong><br />\nExactly. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Are you good?</strong><br />\nI don’t think so. But I’ve gotten a lot better.</p>\n\n<p><strong>And I know you play some of the NY Times games too.</strong><br />\nI do the crossword almost exclusively with a friend over FaceTime. She shares her screen, and we solve them together.</p>\n\n<p>I wasn’t a <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/02/0043979-i-am-a-relative-nyt\">crossword puzzle person</a> beforehand – and I kind of hate Scrabble because at a certain level it’s all about strategy and memorization, which is boring to me. I felt similarly about crossword puzzles, but then she and I started doing them, and I was like, “Oh this is actually pretty fun,” and now we do maybe two or three a week. </p>\n\n<p>And I don’t do Wordle, but I do play the Spelling Bee and Connections. And I’ll do the little mini crosswords on my phone. But a lot of that is just procrastinating about getting out of bed in the morning.</p>\n\n<p><strong>So they’re mostly morning experiences for you?</strong><br />\nYes. I will go back to Spelling Bee, though, if I didn’t do well in the morning. </p>\n\n<p><strong>What’s doing well?</strong><br />\nI don’t get Genius every day, but I would like to. But sometimes I just don’t have the patience for the particular puzzle, and I’m like, I’m sorry, I don’t want to grind.</p>\n\n<p>And I’m not judging others, but for me, if I’m spending too long on the Spelling Bee, it means I probably need to get up and move my body, or, you know, engage my brain in a different way. </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/jksbcopy.jpg\" srcset=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=500,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/jksbcopy.jpg 500w, /cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/jksbcopy.jpg 1200w\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"740\" height=\"1122\" alt=\"jksbcopy.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p><strong>You mentioned that you read <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0143107720/ref=nosim/0sil8\">Middlemarch</a> last year. How did you squeeze that in? Because that’s a commitment.</strong><br />\n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Middlemarch\">Middlemarch</a> was wonderful. I loved it. When you take <a href=\"https://kottke.org/22/05/announcement-im-going-to-miss-you-but-i-am-taking-a-sabbatical\">seven months off work</a>, you can have time to relax, and my reading went crazy. I couldn’t get enough books, because I wasn’t reading anything online. I stopped cold turkey, basically. People would send me links, like, “Here’s an interesting New Yorker article,” and I’m like, nope. Not even news. Not gonna read it. I’m gonna read about Dorothea and Casaubon.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/jkmiddlemarchcopy.jpg\" srcset=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=500,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/jkmiddlemarchcopy.jpg 500w, /cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/jkmiddlemarchcopy.jpg 1200w\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1008\" height=\"1057\" alt=\"jkmiddlemarchcopy.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p><strong>What were other highlights, book-wise, from that time?</strong><br />\nMiddlemarch was definitely the highlight. I don’t know if I’ll ever have another sabbatical like that. It was probably a once-in-a-lifetime thing.</p>\n\n<p>Right now I’m listening to a good audiobook, though: <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/03/the-neo-luddite-movement\">Blood in the Machine</a>, by Brian Merchant. It’s about the Luddites.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/jkbloodcopy.jpg\" srcset=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=500,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/jkbloodcopy.jpg 500w, /cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/jkbloodcopy.jpg 1200w\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"998\" height=\"1042\" alt=\"jkbloodcopy.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>It was painted as an anti-technology movement in the early 19th century, but the book recontextualizes it as a labor movement. Rich factory owners were introducing new technologies, and people were getting laid off. Workers were angry and would go into the factories to smash machines, but they would only smash the ones that were, like, driving people out of work. The machines that actually helped the laborers do their jobs, those were kept.</p>\n\n<p>And he relates it to what’s going on these days with AI and the current anti-tech movement. I’m enjoying it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How did you hear about it?</strong><br />\nI’d seen it on some “best of” lists at the end of 2023, and then Casey Johnston <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/caseyjohnston.bsky.social/post/3kipqxxvlyk2e\">recommended it</a> on Blue Sky. She was like “this book is great,” and so I was like, Okay, that’s good enough for me.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you listen to things most of the time while you’re driving?</strong><br />\nMaybe half the time. I also use driving time to think. Like if there’s some work thing I need to think over, I’ll put on music without words, and just, you know, spin the wheels.</p>\n\n<p>But when I don’t feel like doing that, I’ll listen to an audiobook or podcast.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What kinds of music do you listen to?</strong><br />\nThe music thing is embarrassing because I don’t listen to a lot of, like, new music. André 3000’s flute album is maybe the newest thing I’ve listened to recently.</p>\n\n<p>I can’t write when the music has lyrics, so when I’m working I play a lot of classical and soundtracks. Also videos on YouTube. One of my favorites is just basically <a href=\"https://kottke.org/17/02/the-relaxing-sounds-of-an-arctic-icebreaker'\">an ice breaker idling in the Arctic during a storm</a>.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/jktrawlercopy.jpg\" srcset=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=500,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/jktrawlercopy.jpg 500w, /cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/jktrawlercopy.jpg 1200w\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"930\" alt=\"jktrawlercopy.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>I also listen to a lot of electronic music, at varying levels of, uh, what would be considered good? And when I’m programming or designing, I listen to a lot of upbeat house, club, and techno.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Anything you’ve seen recently that just wasn’t for you? </strong><br />\nRebel Moon on Netflix was bad. Not even “not for me.” Just objectively terrible.</p>\n\n<p><strong>And something you loved?</strong><br />\n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/03/0044179-jonathan-glazers-the-zone\">The Zone of Interest</a>. I saw it a few weeks ago and have thinking about it ever since, especially the sound design.</p>\n\n <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/American%20Prometheus\">American Prometheus</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Blood%20in%20the%20Machine\">Blood in the Machine</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/crossword%20puzzles\">crossword puzzles</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Drawing%20Media\">Drawing Media</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Dune\">Dune</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/interviews\">interviews</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Jason%20Kottke\">Jason Kottke</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Middlemarch\">Middlemarch</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Spelling%20Bee\">Spelling Bee</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/The%20Zone%20of%20Interest\">The Zone of Interest</a></p>\n\n <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/03/drawing-media-with-jason-k\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Edith Zimmerman","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"c8e8618bd3eddc30668592d468654987aa159df96efab43c1772a60e3c45a0bb","category":"default"}
