Small little bits of creative color, that may or may not be connected to the story they are next to. And sometimes connected in non-obvious ways, intended to make you think.</p>\n<p>Then NakedJen sent me a recent picture of herself that's perfect for the right margin. Seen in the right margin of this post.</p>\n<p>Here's a <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/manyImages.html\">page</a> where you can scroll through the collection of images I can choose from. I'd love to add more creative stuff here. And I'd love to get some of Stan Krute's genius or Brad Pettit or whoever else might be so inspired. </p>\n<p>No promises about when or if they'd be used. You can post them here, as comments on this message if you like. </p>\n<p>I may have to restrict this to people I follow, just letting you know, based on past experience. </p>","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"9a4ef61f3a778f82a15d2ffa1065cf39f83cf8f90a74902f5fa01fecfde23026","category":"default"}
