Then he takes readers along with him to Columbia, South Carolina, where he reports on his own book’s banning, but also explores the larger backlash to the nation’s recent reckoning with history and the deeply rooted American mythology so visible in that city — a capital of the Confederacy with statues of segregationists looming over its public squares. Finally, in the book’s longest section, Coates travels to Palestine, where he sees with devastating clarity how easily we are misled by nationalist narratives, and the tragedy that lies in the clash between the stories we tell and the reality of life on the ground.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://longform.org/posts/longform-podcast-584-ta-nehisi-coates\">Coates was recently a guest on the Longform podcast</a> and he talked about one of the central themes of the book (“how the stories we tell — and the ones we don’t — shape our realities”):</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>There’s a certain sector of politics on the right that really correctly understands that cultural issues are very, very powerful, actually. That books and movies and TV shows and monuments and statues and art, all that stuff actually really does matter and has a huge effect on what we consider actual politics, which is to say voting, legislation, etcetera. Because our whole notions of humanity are derived from these things. They’re derived from, you know, stories. They’re derived from the news. They’re derived from, you know, art. They derive from statues. That’s how we decide, you know, who is what.</p>\n\n<p>And the reason, you know it’s powerful is because in previous eras — for instance, when during the era of redemption, it became extremely important to destroy the multiracial democracies that have been raised in the South. They went after the history. They went after the stories. That’s where all those monuments come from. Those monuments are not just raised out of nothing. It’s not a mistake that it wasn’t until the early 1960s the Southern states started putting up the Confederate battle flag. They understood the power of the symbol. They know. They know. And now they find themselves in an era where there is a very real cultural war, by which I mean: the hegemony that they once enjoyed over the culture is actually actively being challenged, and that is a long term threat to the politics that they represent.</p>\n\n<p>So, I mean, a lot of people say, oh, this is a distraction. I actually think it’s quite intelligent. While it’s not the response I would have, I don’t think it’s a deluded response or delusional response, rather.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>It sounds fascinating — <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0593230388/ref=nosim/0sil8\">I definitely preordered</a>.</p>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/books\">books</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/politics\">politics</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Ta-Nehisi%20Coates\">Ta-Nehisi Coates</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/The%20Message\">The Message</a></p>\n\n         <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/06/the-message-by-ta-nehisi-coates\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"ec297db11bea1a76122d5af50a707e450af13b1529e40f2f9804262ebaa844ab","category":"default"}
