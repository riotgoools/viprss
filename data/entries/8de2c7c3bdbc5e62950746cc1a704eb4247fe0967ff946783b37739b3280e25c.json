Sora probably will be good for TikTok and other short video services. It is not hard to imagine services that splice your Sora-constructed videos into your TikTok productions. So if you’re doing <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.tiktok.com/tag/BookTok\" target=\"_blank\">BookTok</a>, for example, maybe you put a battle reenactment in the background of your plug for your new book on the US Civil War.</p>\r\n<p>Perhaps the most significant short-run use of these videos will be for advertising — especially internet advertising. Again, there is the question of how to integrate narrative, but the costs of creating new ads is likely to fall.</p>\r\n<p>More advertising may sound like a mixed blessing. But ads will almost certainly be more fun and creative than they are now. Watching ads may become its own aesthetic avocation, as is already the case for Super Bowl ads. These ads also might be targeted, rather than serving a mass audience. If your internet history suggests you are <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-12-10/ufo-enthusiasts-should-rethink-their-stance-on-government-secrecy?sref=EP6bV7CS\" target=\"_blank\">interested in UAPs</a>, for example, perhaps you will see ads with aliens telling you which soap to buy.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>And to close:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>At the most speculative level, the success of Sora may increase the chance that <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation_hypothesis\" target=\"_blank\">we are living in a simulation</a> — a computer-based world created by some high-powered being, whether a deity or aliens. Is that bullish or bearish for asset prices? It depends on how you assess the responsibility and ethics of the creator. At the very least, our planet Earth simulator seems to be able to generate videos that last longer than a single minute. Beyond that, I cannot say.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>There is much more at the link, interesting throughout.</p>\r\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/02/the-commercial-impact-of-sora.html\">The commercial impact of Sora</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com\">Marginal REVOLUTION</a>.</p>\r\n<img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/871927214/0/marginalrevolution\" />\r\n<div><a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/871927214/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/871927214/marginalrevolution,\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/871927214/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/x.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/871927214/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/871927214/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/02/the-commercial-impact-of-sora.html#respond\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/comments20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/02/the-commercial-impact-of-sora.html/feed\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/commentsrss20.png\" /></a><h3>Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/02/chatgpt-as-a-predictor-of-corporate-investment.html?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=chatgpt-as-a-predictor-of-corporate-investment\">ChatGPT as a predictor of corporate investment</a></li><li><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/02/centaur-chess-is-now-run-by-computers.html?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=centaur-chess-is-now-run-by-computers\">“Centaur chess” is now run by computers</a></li><li><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/02/my-view-of-casablanca-with-spoilers-but-youve-seen-it-already.html?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=my-view-of-casablanca-with-spoilers-but-youve-seen-it-already\">My view of *Casablanca* (with spoilers, but you’ve seen it already?)</a></li></ul> </div>","author":"Tyler Cowen","siteTitle":"Marginal Revolution","siteHash":"242a3a39129b36e0c574c3796ca7ef3cf8af967286c2998fabf7240d1ad52a47","entryHash":"8de2c7c3bdbc5e62950746cc1a704eb4247fe0967ff946783b37739b3280e25c","category":"default"}
