Also, last week, <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2024/01/09/elon-musk-x-video-first-platform/?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=a-new-way-to-measure-x-s-current-level-of-decay\" target=\"_blank\">declared</a> that X was a “video-first platform”. So he’s now <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1747047100502999141?s=12&amp;t=GArJOEJ41SKT7sLfzFsugQ&amp;utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=a-new-way-to-measure-x-s-current-level-of-decay\" target=\"_blank\">spinning</a> MrBeast’s first full-length upload as a big win to celebrate. MrBeast had <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-67983758?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=a-new-way-to-measure-x-s-current-level-of-decay\" target=\"_blank\">previously said</a> he wasn’t going to post anything to X because his videos are too expensive to waste them there. (My words, not his lol.)</p><p>Neither Musk or MrBeast, however, have acknowledged that this wasn’t an exclusive video for X, nor is it even a new video. It premiered on his YouTube channel back in September. But the fact MrBeast has finally soft-embraced X, the everything app that is also now a video-first app, is useful for measuring X’s current level of decay. </p><p>As of this morning, the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrLj6nc516A&amp;utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=a-new-way-to-measure-x-s-current-level-of-decay\" target=\"_blank\">original upload</a> of “$1 vs $100,000,000 Car,” on YouTube has 212 million views. After about two days on X, it has 78 million. Which seems pretty good until you realize those are views for the X post the video is embedded in. It seems like not an accident that we can no longer see views on X videos anymore. The post has 29,000 shares, which means it’s getting about an average of 2,600 passive views every time someone shares it. Though, I’m sure a bulk of those views come from Musk’s followers. And, unlike when you watch it on YouTube, there weren’t any ads that played ahead of it when I watched it. There is a sponsored segment towards the end of the video, which may be why they used this one. And there were a few (disclosed) ads in the replies beneath it. </p><p>“I’m super curious how much the ad revenue will make,” MrBeast posted. Musk didn’t respond to that, but separately replied, “It’s a great time to be a content creator on 𝕏.” My guess is it will not make nearly as much as it made on YouTube. Based on rough estimates, the original video probably made around $1 million when it was originally uploaded.</p><p>It’s also worth noting here that a huge chunk of the replies underneath the video are from transphobes raging over MrBeast’s long-time friend and collaborator Kris Tyson, a trans woman, who appears in the video. And as journalist Rachel Gilmore <a href=\"https://www.threads.net/@r.gilmore/post/C2LcFuyAsk6?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=a-new-way-to-measure-x-s-current-level-of-decay\" target=\"_blank\">pointed out</a> on Threads, the fact that MrBeast primarily makes videos for children and is now generating headlines by bringing those videos to X, almost certainly means at least some of his audience is going to see the absolute hell that are X replies. Though, I’m pretty sure most children are seeing just as much hate speech in YouTube comments these days. Also, before it gets lost in the shuffle here, I think MrBeast being unflinchingly normal about Tyson’s transition is a truly radical act considering the size of his platform and he does deserve credit for that.</p><p>The most interesting thing about all of this, though, is how differently MrBeast and Musk approach the internet. For folks who only know MrBeast as the comic sans thumbnail man, you might not realize he’s optimizing his videos for maximum views on each platform he posts on, with specific videos and edits for TikTok, Instagram, and even Facebook. While Musk has an almost opposite philosophy, if you can even call it that, where he just assume the internet — and reality — will bend to whatever insane whim he comes up with. To point where he thinks MrBeast, someone who exclusively makes all-ages content aimed at tweens, should be publishing on an app that, at this point, has degraded into a platform almost entirely populated by neo-Nazis, OnlyFans models, and uncensored videos of horrific violence. I mean, the other day I saw an ad on the site for a gator park in Florida, which, you know, seemed cool, I guess, but it’s not really in the same league as the ads playing on MrBeast videos on YouTube.</p><p>But, also, this entire “X isn’t actually a failing social network, but the beginning of a video app that can beat YouTube” narrative from Musk is just a mad scramble to keep investors from repossessing the site. It’s the start of a new pyramid scheme to invest in. And it’s especially ironic to try and convince MrBeast to get involved when the only thing he has ever done throughout his entire career is convert internet traffic into ad revenue by obsessing measuring how different platforms print money.</p><hr /><h2>Consider supporting Garbage Day!</h2><p>It’s $5 a month or $45 a year for paywalled issues and Discord access and $150 a year for all that, plus monthly trend reports.

But I basically use the same methodology for everything, which I think straddles a line I’m comfortable with between outright doomerism and unhinged optimism. And it basically goes like this:</p><p>Whenever there’s a new thing, I try and play with it and use it to look for some fun culture angles. Then, as I learn more about it, I try and assess if there’s any real long-term juice to it. If there is, I start turning up the heat a bit and asking bigger questions. If there isn’t, like, say, with the live audio fad, I typically go scorched earth and move on. </p><p>But the reason I try to keep an open mind (try) is because there have been countless things in the world of tech over the years that I thought were pretty stupid and wrote off entirely, only to be very wrong. The iPhone, Spotify, and TikTok were all things I assumed, uh, would pass. Whoops! So now, I try not to do that, if only so I don’t have to play catch up later.</p><p>But it’s 2024 and generative AI has had a few years to figure itself out and now I think is the right time to really ask where all of this is going. So… where is this all going?</p><p>Well, OpenAI has a new GPT store, which is sort of like an app store, but for ChatGPT wrappers. I <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90983742/openai-custom-gpt-everything-you-need-to-know-about-how-to-use-them-and-build-your-own?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=a-new-way-to-measure-x-s-current-level-of-decay\" target=\"_blank\">wrote a piece</a> about the concept back in November, but it’s finally live. Journalist Scott Nover recently <a href=\"https://www.gzeromedia.com/gzero-ai/is-the-gpt-store-the-next-big-internet-marketplace?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=a-new-way-to-measure-x-s-current-level-of-decay\" target=\"_blank\">wrote a great piece</a> about trying to find some use for it. He had mixed results.</p><p>“When I engaged with the hiking chatbot, I wondered why it needed to be a chatbot,” Nover wrote. “Wouldn’t a map do better? I navigated to the AllTrails website and found a very engaging experience with maps, weather data, user-generated reviews, a warning about mosquitos, and directions. Isn’t this a better experience than a chatbot?”</p><p>Which is basically, more often than not, <a href=\"https://www.garbageday.email/p/the-digital-equivalent-of-wearing?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=a-new-way-to-measure-x-s-current-level-of-decay\" target=\"_blank\">my feeling</a> on the entire generative AI movement now. None of it seems to be making anything better, just a different kind of annoying. </p><hr /><h2>Unfortunately, You Have To Stan The Colombian Woman Who Falsely Claimed She Personally Animated 28% Of <i>The Boy and the Heron</i></h2><div><img src=\"https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/bf928e21-f483-4e22-9115-33c18a51ff3c/10f677de-d0f9-4dcf-8e21-012c652805b0_1094x932.png?t=1705691537\" /></div><p>This story is wild. An illustrator from Colombia named Geraldine Fernández told both her followers on social media, as well as local newspapers, that she personally animated thousands of frames in the recent Studio Ghibli film, <i>The Boy and the Heron</i>.

Basically, an omegaverse mod.</p><p>A man who hit on her at a party and was turned down, then reported her to British law enforcement as revenge, according to the Reddit post. What many Americans did not realize until this went viral this week is that this kind of <i>Skyrim</i> mod could actually be illegal in the UK. </p><p>First off, the UK doesn’t have the first amendment. And, second, back in the late 2000s, the country passed a law against what it classifies as “extreme pornography,” which largely pertains to depictions of bestiality, but other kinds of content fall into this category, as well. The illegality of “extreme pornography” largely depends on how realistically its rendered. </p><p>I first learned about all of this back in late 2014, when there <a href=\"https://www.dailydot.com/unclick/tiger-porn-britain-law/?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=a-new-way-to-measure-x-s-current-level-of-decay\" target=\"_blank\">was a big extreme pornography case</a> that played out right around when I was moving to London, which centered around tiger porn. </p><hr /><h2>Hasan Asked The Yemini Pirate If He Knows What <i>One Piece</i> Is</h2><div><img src=\"https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/2906285c-48a2-41a7-aed8-9fb34bc6bf74/1880c7f8-2ca0-4eeb-b96a-e1c56a8bb42a_1060x594.png?t=1705691540\" /></div><p>Leftist Twitch streamer Hasan Piker interviewed the 19-year-old Yemeni pirate that recently went viral on TikTok for being handsome. (What a world, etc.) The pirate goes by Rashid al-Haddad, but has been nicknamed “Timhouthi Chalamet”. His account was swiftly removed by TikTok after it went viral.</p><p>During the interview, Piker asked al-Haddad if he had ever watched the anime <i>One Piece </i>(it’s about pirates). And al-Haddad said yes, he’s been watching it since he was a kid.
