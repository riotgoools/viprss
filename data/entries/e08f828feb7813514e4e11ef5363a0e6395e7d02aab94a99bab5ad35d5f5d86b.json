It’s unclear what happens next. </p><p>President Biden has said that he <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/trump-raises-concerns-about-us-ban-tiktok-2024-03-08/?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=what-if-nobody-owned-our-children-s-data\" target=\"_blank\">would sign the bill</a> if it <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=men-vp5jvzI&amp;utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=what-if-nobody-owned-our-children-s-data\" target=\"_blank\">makes it to his desk</a>. But on Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer told CNN that he <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/13/politics/house-vote-tiktok-ban-bill/index.html?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=what-if-nobody-owned-our-children-s-data\" target=\"_blank\">wasn't sure</a> if the Senate would hold a vote — which would mean the bill might not even end up with Biden in the first place. And in the Senate, there are signs of partisan disagreement: Sen. Rand Paul has been very outspoken <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/03/12/tik-tok-bill-house-vote/?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=what-if-nobody-owned-our-children-s-data\" target=\"_blank\">about blocking it</a>, as has former President Trump. Republicans, free speech, broken clock, etc.</p><p>I've gamed out the different outcomes here a <a href=\"https://www.garbageday.email/p/misinformation-fun?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=what-if-nobody-owned-our-children-s-data\" target=\"_blank\">few times now</a>, but here are the basics of the situation: If ByteDance divests TikTok, it'll likely cycle through a bunch of owners, get mined for all its user data, and in the process lose its competitive edge. There are a million TikTok clones and all of them could easily outpace the app if it got Musk'd. You know, if previous sales of sites like Myspace, Tumblr, and Twitter are anything to go on.</p><p>If ByteDance <span><i>doesn't</i></span> divest the company, it'll pull out of the US entirely. Most of the research I've seen <a href=\"https://whatsthebigdata.com/tiktok-statistics/?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=what-if-nobody-owned-our-children-s-data\" target=\"_blank\">indicates</a> that the second and third biggest countries on TikTok are Indonesia and Brazil, in terms of total users. In fact, the US is the only English-speaking country in the top 10. So the app would change pretty drastically for the users still on it.</p><p>As for how it would feel inside the US, well, that’s also up in the air. The largest country to ban TikTok is India, which blocked the app in 2020. As <span><i>Rest Of World</i></span> <a href=\"https://restofworld.org/2023/america-india-tiktok-ban/?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=what-if-nobody-owned-our-children-s-data\" target=\"_blank\">pointed out</a>, it actually didn't affect local creators all that much. They just went to other platforms. Which is probably what would happen here: some kind of mass migration to Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts. Even so, a ban would massively shake up America’s cultural landscape. TikTok has a <span><i>huge</i></span> amount of influence on the music industry, for example. Though of course, Universal Music Group might kill that even without a federal ban. </p><p>All that said, US content might still be popular on TikTok. Like India, Russia is also theoretically not on TikTok. But Russian content, in Russian, still trends regularly on the app. In November, the biggest hashtag on TikTok was <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/%D1%81%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%BF%D0%B0%D1%86%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B0?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=what-if-nobody-owned-our-children-s-data\" target=\"_blank\">for the premiere</a> of <span><i>The Boy's Word: Blood on the Asphalt</i></span>, a Russian crime drama.</p><p>In addition, we'll probably still see TikToks in the event of a total ban — because we still see things like Douyin videos, which come from an app trapped behind China's Great Firewall. TikTok videos are downloadable and every other platform supports TikTok-like content now, so the watermark will absolutely keep popping up on apps like Instagram. None of this matters, though. </p><p>The anti-TikTok push in Washington is built on top of a mess of false assumptions and bizarre contradictions. As John Herrman <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/why-the-tiktok-ban-is-scrambling-washington.html?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=what-if-nobody-owned-our-children-s-data\" target=\"_blank\">pointed out</a> in <span><i>New York Magazine</i></span> this week, the app has been banned on federal phones since late 2022, so lawmakers that aren't using burners don't really know how to use the app or what it’s like to be on it. But they assume it's a powerful Chinese cyberweapon and, troublingly, want to own it. </p><p>The problem is, Washington can't nationalize TikTok the way they think China has. So they're fine offering it up to Silicon Valley or banning it entirely. Because they either think Silicon Valley can run it just as well, or because they think it’d be easy for the geniuses in the valley to spin up a new globally relevant video app. Except they can't. Because if they could, they would have built TikTok. If you’d have asked me, in 2018, whether or not I thought lawmakers would be talking about TikTok the way those scientists in <span><i>Watchmen</i></span> <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Kdd-2HQ0oOo?t=88&amp;utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=what-if-nobody-owned-our-children-s-data\" target=\"_blank\">talk about Dr. Manhattan</a> just six years later, I would have thought you were out of your mind. </p><p>In fact, White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan asked reporters yesterday: \"Do we want the data from TikTok — children’s data, adults’ data — to be going — to be staying here in America or going to China?\" </p><p>What about, uh, no one? What if nobody had… our children's data?</p><hr /><p><i>The following is a paid ad.

The conspiracy was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ConceptualJames/status/1767208090150060079?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=what-if-nobody-owned-our-children-s-data\" target=\"_blank\">picked up</a> by several large <a href=\"https://twitter.com/stillgray/status/1767681553755509171?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=what-if-nobody-owned-our-children-s-data\" target=\"_blank\">right-wing influencers</a> this week, no doubt spreading it beyond gaming communities. Even Elon Musk <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1767644345547547113?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=what-if-nobody-owned-our-children-s-data\" target=\"_blank\">has tweeted</a> about it. Concerning. </p><p><span><i>Aftermath</i></span> has a <a href=\"https://aftermath.site/sweet-baby-detected-conspiracy-theory-steam?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=what-if-nobody-owned-our-children-s-data\" target=\"_blank\">good piece</a> breaking down how this whole thing started, but here are the broad strokes. Late last year, radicalized gaming communities on sites like Reddit and X began ranting about a black character named Saga Anderson in the video game <span><i>Alan Wake 2</i></span>. Users noticed that Sweet Baby — which describes itself as an \"inclusion-focused narrative and consultation company” — had worked on the game, and subsequently decided they were the reason the game included a black character. Not, you know, because the creative people at the studio who were in charge of a hundred million dollar project wanted to include a black person in the game for their own reasons. <br /><br />Gamers started a Steam group to track other games that Sweet Baby had consulted on and have since concocted an elaborate theory that the company is forcing some kind of “woke agenda” on studios and ruining their games.  </p><p>If you have a normal brain, you might not understand why gamers care if games don't sell well.  But you have to remember that gamers treat intellectual property the way sports fans treat teams. So if, say, a game about DC Comics' <span><i>Suicide Squad</i></span> — which Sweet Baby worked on — doesn't sell well, they treat it as a personal affront and start looking for someone to blame. Because, again, they equate their self worth with consumerism.</p><p>I've been calling this whole thing Gamergate 2. But that’s maybe the wrong name, because it's moving much faster. Gamergate did not immediately manifest as a coherent political movement. It <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2020/1/20/20808875/gamergate-lessons-cultural-impact-changes-harassment-laws?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=what-if-nobody-owned-our-children-s-data\" target=\"_blank\">started in 2014</a> as an angry blog post with no basis in reality written by an aggrieved ex-boyfriend, alleging his former partner, indie game dev Zoë Quinn, was part of a media conspiracy to give good reviews to woke games.</p><p>The Sweet Baby conspiracy, however, is already off to the races. This is how mainstream conservative activism works now: make something up to be mad at, and stuff all of your weird culture war grievances into it. It’s a shame, because all this could have been stopped if the spaces Gamergate grew in were moderated properly in the first place. </p><hr /><h2>Andrew Tate Was Taken Into Custody Because A Streamer Accidentally Revealed His Plans To Flee The Country</h2><blockquote><p></p><p>Adin Ross apologizes to Andrew Tate after causing him to get arrested.</p><p></p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/DailyLoud/status/1767917278736110046?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=what-if-nobody-owned-our-children-s-data\"><p> — Daily Loud (@DailyLoud) <br /> Mar 13, 2024 </p></a></blockquote><p>Livestreamer Adin Ross told his audience this week that Men's Rights podcaster and alleged human trafficker Andrew Tate invited him to Romania for a week of \"long streams and content,\" after which Tate planned to leave the country and never come back.</p><p>Ross's stream was enough for Romanian authorities to detain Tate again, and this time he <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/andrew-tate-arrest-prompted-adin-ross-stream-says-law-firm-rcna143009?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=what-if-nobody-owned-our-children-s-data\" target=\"_blank\">was served</a> an arrest warrant by UK law enforcement.
