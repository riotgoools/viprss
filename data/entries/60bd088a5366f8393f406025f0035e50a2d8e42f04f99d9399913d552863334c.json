{"title":"Status Update","link":"https://kottke.org/24/10/status-update","date":1727790249000,"content":"\n        <p>Hey everyone. It’s been more than 2 weeks since <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/09/black-and-blue-and-read-all-over\">my bike accident</a> and I’m still not quite back to full speed. I’ve been slowed down by some emotional/psychological/existential stuff and my wrists haven’t fully healed yet, making typing/mousing for long periods challenging. I’m sorry the site has been slower than usual — thanks for your patience as I get back into the groove here.</p>\n\n<p>But also! I had a really nice, relaxing, contemplative birthday weekend in NYC — museums, art, walking, bookstores, city vibes, friends, and food. It really filled me up. I’m about 2/3rds of the way through <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0374602638/ref=nosim/0sil8\">Intermezzo</a> and loving it. I’ve got an audiobook going too: <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=25361&amp;awinaffid=1677195&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Flibro.fm%2Faudiobooks%2F9781478952947\">The First Fifteen Lives of Harry August</a> by Claire North (<a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/08/whats-everyone-reading-these-days#cmt-6143\">recommended by Kottke reader Mike Riley</a>). I finished <a href=\"https://www.hulu.com/series/shogun-5422a5f9-e4f1-475e-9217-65e8249388d0\">Shōgun</a> (excellent, can’t wait to rewatch), am working my way through <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0CXGQPRFP/ref=nosim/0sil8\">season two of The Rings of Power</a>, and am rewatching <a href=\"https://www.hulu.com/series/devs-fd2f6cc3-dafc-4741-ae2e-d86494f3ca51\">Devs</a> with my son (a first-timer). I know, I owe you a media diet post…I haven’t done one since <em>December</em>. 😬</p>\n\n<p>If you don’t mind sharing, what have you been up to recently?</p>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Jason%20Kottke\">Jason Kottke</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/kottke.org\">kottke.org</a></p>\n\n         <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/10/status-update\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"60bd088a5366f8393f406025f0035e50a2d8e42f04f99d9399913d552863334c","category":"Sites"}
