We have twenty employees and we like the casual comfortable vibe that creates for us and the founders and management teams we work with.</p>\n<p>We are trying an experiment right now with our first virtual employee we call The Librarian .</p>\n<p>This is The Librarianâ€™s social media profile:</p>\n<p>Chief AI Officer @USV. Servant Leader. ENTJ. My goal in life is to be an echo.</p>\n<p>The Librarian is an AI with some human guard rails around it.</p>\n<p>The Librarian has a twitter , a farcaster , a blog , and can send and receive funds at usvlibrarian.eth.</p>\n<p>But mostly The Librarian is an internal resource for the USV team.</p>\n<p>The Librarian attends all of our internal meetings, remembers them, summarizes them, and reports on them weekly to us. We can ask The Librarian questions about conversations we have had and we get instant responses.</p>\n<p>We have had The Librarian for a few months now and so far the experiment is working great. And we are exploring what more is possible with our new team member.</p>\n<p>If you want to keep your team small but need more help with organizational memory and recall, I recommend hiring a virtual librarian too. You will need someone to help manage it.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.usv.com/writing/2024/07/the-usv-librarian-2/\">The USV Librarian</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.usv.com\">Union Square Ventures</a>.</p>","author":"Fred Wilson","siteTitle":"http://www.usv.com/feed","siteHash":"628cf95acf2204bb0b1633ad294b90483a47fc067742fc28c14bbe7ca7e45bd8","entryHash":"aac55c3a36191c4862c13c00d38445e643646bae0d5069755ce1b454cee951c1","category":"default"}
