The performance is fun, and Cranston gets an ad-libbed laugh by archly reading “Shea Stadium,” a part of Moses’ legacy that was demolished and replaced in 2009. Cranston’s also reads some of the famous list sections that Caro rattles off in The Power Broker’s opening chapters. The drumbeat of names is Caro’s attempt to contextualize the scale of Moses’ impact, a technique cribbed from The Aeneid.</p></blockquote>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/books\">books</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Bryan%20Cranston\">Bryan Cranston</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Robert%20Caro\">Robert Caro</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/The%20Power%20Broker\">The Power Broker</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/video\">video</a></p>\n\n         <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/12/bryan-cranston-reads-from-robert-caros-the-power-broker\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"1ed3f53b56a7f5907176ed66394901cae1251b5b862f7b7397dd88d48e6b5ef8","category":"Sites"}
