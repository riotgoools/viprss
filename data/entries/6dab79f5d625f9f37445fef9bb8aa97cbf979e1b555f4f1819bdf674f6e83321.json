One frosh even told me that <em>all </em>of her first quarter classes are contract graded. How does this set students up for success at Stanford and beyond?</p>\r\n<p><strong>President Levin:</strong> So the COLLEGE curriculum, that’s  part of the design—and of course, it’s a new course. So many aspects of COLLEGE are an experiment. We’re learning. The faculty who teach it are learning about the best design for that class, what the syllabus should look like, what’s the best way to manage discussion, what’s the teaching model, what’s the grading model. And that’s something that the Faculty Senate discussed maybe 18 months ago or last year, the grading model, and at the time, they presented some evidence suggesting that it seemed to have been a positive experience.</p></blockquote>\r\n<p>Here is <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://stanfordreview.org/levin-interview/\" target=\"_blank\">the link</a>, Julia Steinberg did a great job.  Interesting throughout.  Jon you are an awesome economist, but you have to have much better answers than these, even by the standards of bureaucratic blah blah blah.  We are looking to you to save Stanford, and bring a modicum of leadership and common sense, after the previous president was revealed to be a fraudster, among his other drawbacks.  But more is needed than simply trying not to answer any of the questions!</p>\r\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/12/interview-with-jonathan-levin.html\">Interview with Jonathan Levin, economist and Stanford president</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com\">Marginal REVOLUTION</a>.</p>\r\n<img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/908810600/0/marginalrevolution\" />\r\n<div><a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/908810600/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/908810600/marginalrevolution,\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/908810600/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/x.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/908810600/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/908810600/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/12/interview-with-jonathan-levin.html#comments\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/comments20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/12/interview-with-jonathan-levin.html/feed\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/commentsrss20.png\" /></a> \r\n<div><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/12/interview-with-jonathan-levin.html#comments\"><h3>Comments</h3></a><ul><li><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/12/interview-with-jonathan-levin.html#comment-160843210\">In reply to Dismalist.   poor bastard thought he was going to ...</a> <i>by dave schutz</i></li><li><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/12/interview-with-jonathan-levin.html#comment-160842813\">In reply to Moral Panic.
