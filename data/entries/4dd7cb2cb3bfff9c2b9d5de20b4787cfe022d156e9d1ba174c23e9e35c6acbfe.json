The two concepts are <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonality\">orthogonal</a>. I do not support the Israeli government any more than I supported the government of my country, the United States, when the MAGAs were in charge. We lost over 1 million American citizens who did not have to die imho, because our government was not only immoral and hugely corrupt, but also made no attempt to govern. I am a child of Holocaust survivors and an American born in the USA, and am proud of and grateful to this country. Any American is free to protest the actions of our government or any other government, or really anything. If you don't believe in that then you aren't actually trying to make America great, you're saying something altogether different and incompatible. I am also deeply offended at Americans who propose to speak for me. That actually is antisemitic, btw.","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"4dd7cb2cb3bfff9c2b9d5de20b4787cfe022d156e9d1ba174c23e9e35c6acbfe","category":"default"}
