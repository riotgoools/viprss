Fifty times? Definitely. One hundred times? Maybe! It’s definitely one of my favorite movies of all time. Today <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/01/the-ferris-bueller-finale-with-music-from-inception\">Kottke posted a video</a> of the final big sequence where Ferris is running through backyards and homes, racing to beat his parents (and Jeanie) home. Only this video was recut with score music from the film, Inception. It’s… interesting, but even with the audio turned off, I can’t help but hear <a href=\"https://song.link/i/1714523409\">“March Of The Swivel Heads” by The English Beat</a>.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"micro.brad","siteHash":"27daae1c149c6ec5a964b1fe9266f5a58f96cfb4b36e39006f255c6b2b53a76d","entryHash":"5562612ea22b5eefce63a252ebd1a75057b513d61e7cfa4ebff4ede3b9a4fa3e","category":"default"}
