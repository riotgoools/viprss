Twitter kicked butt when it came out in 2006 and the butt it kicked was the <i>feed</i>iverse. Why? Because it was too damned hard and unnecessarily complicated to subscribe to a feed. In Twitter there was a button on each feed page that said Subscribe. Click and you're subscribed. That's it. May sound like a small matter, but it's not. Listen wherever you get your podcasts. I've been dying to say that. 12 minutes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"5f558184f70b10855ec9fec51b4b1ff00802f946ef5780a4eff0ad2fe864d1bd","category":"default"}
