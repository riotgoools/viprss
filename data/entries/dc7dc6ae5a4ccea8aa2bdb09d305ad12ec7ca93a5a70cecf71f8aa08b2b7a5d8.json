{"title":"We&#8217;re in the Golden Age of Mid TV","link":"https://kottke.org/24/04/were-in-the-golden-age-of-mid-tv","date":1714401682000,"content":"\n        <p>TV critic James Poniewozik <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/27/arts/television/mid-tv.html?unlocked_article_code=1.oE0.8Bfm.OYcqiUg-VWaa\">writing for the NY Times</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>Mid TV, on the other hand, almost can’t be bad for some of the same reasons that keep it from being great. It’s often an echo of the last generation of breakthrough TV (so the highs and lows of “Game of Thrones” are succeeded by the faithful adequacy of “House of the Dragon”). Or it’s made by professionals who know how to make TV too well, and therefore miss a prerequisite of making great art, which is training yourself to forget how the thing was ever done and thus coming up with your own way of doing it.</p>\n\n<p>Mid is not a strict genre with a universal definition. But it’s what you get when you raise TV’s production values and lower its ambitions. It reminds you a little of something you once liked a lot. It substitutes great casting for great ideas. (You really liked the star in that other thing! You can’t believe they got Meryl Streep!)</p>\n\n<p>Mid is based on a well-known book or movie or murder. Mid looks great on a big screen. (Though for some reason everything looks blue.) Mid was shot on location in multiple countries. Mid probably could have been a couple episodes shorter. Mid is fine, though. It’s good enough.</p>\n\n<p>Above all, Mid is easy. It’s not dumb easy — it shows evidence that its writers have read books. But the story beats are familiar. Plot points and themes are repeated. You don’t have to immerse yourself single-mindedly the way you might have with, say, “The Wire.” It is prestige TV that you can fold laundry to.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Bullseye. Although I also agree with <a href=\"https://www.threads.net/@sepinwall/post/C6Rq4AtJ-jq\">this caveat from Alan Sepinwall</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>I’d only take issue with this excellent Poniewozik essay in the sense that not all Mid TV is created equal. Poker Face and Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith are great examples of the kinds of shows they want to be. I’d rather have those than all these wild swings by people who don’t understand how to make TV.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>For me, the problem with Mid TV is differentiating it from actual good TV…finding shows that you actually don’t want to fold laundry to. I’ve gotten burned a few times on shows that I thought were going to be challenging &amp; interesting — Constellation, 1899, and Mrs. Davis come to mind — but were just sort of aggressively fine (so much so that it turned me off).</p>\n\n<p>Two more thoughts, from the comments section of Poniewozik’s piece. I love this re: specificity:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>Shogun is by far the best show released this year, and it has an enormous amount to do with its *specificity* of artistic vision. All of the “mid” shows otherwise referenced here are trying to achieve too many things at once or appeal to too many demographics to have much of an impact. They are content, not art.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>It’s a contradictory truth that if you want to create something that really connects with people (even a lot of people), you gotta make it specific or personal (or both). Shogun is right at the top of my to-watch list (after I finish the five shows I’m <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/02/stinge-watching\">stinge watching</a>).</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>Writer of TV here. I won awards for an iconic HBO show. I can tell you that 95 percent of the blame here lies with the executives who are now so scared to lose their jobs that they just go right down the middle — to the mid, if you will. It’s easier to say yes to a show they have seen before than take a risk on something outside the box.</p>\n\n<p>And yes, they are using AI to give us “notes”. I feel very lucky to have worked in this medium when it still rewarded real creativity.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Sounds about right.</p>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Alan%20Sepinwall\">Alan Sepinwall</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/art\">art</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/James%20Poniewozik\">James Poniewozik</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/TV\">TV</a></p>\n\n         <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/04/were-in-the-golden-age-of-mid-tv\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"dc7dc6ae5a4ccea8aa2bdb09d305ad12ec7ca93a5a70cecf71f8aa08b2b7a5d8","category":"default"}
