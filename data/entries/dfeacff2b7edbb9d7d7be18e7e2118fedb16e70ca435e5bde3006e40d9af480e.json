Last but certainly not least, Generative AI may be the largest technology transformation since the cloud (which itself, is still in the early stages), and perhaps since the Internet.</p></blockquote>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://reports.jpmorganchase.com/investor-relations/2023/ar-ceo-letters.htm\"> Jamie Dimon Sharehold letter</a><br />\n<blockquote><p>While we are investing more money in our AI capabilities, many of these projects pay for themselves. Over time, we anticipate that our use of AI has the potential to augment virtually every job, as well as impact our workforce composition. It may reduce certain job categories or roles, but it may create others as well. As we have in the past, we will aggressively retrain and redeploy our talent to make sure we are taking care of our employees if they are affected by this trend.</p></blockquote>\n<p><em></em></p>\n<p>…ed note: tried a set up paragraph instead of just links for context and framing; started first with ai and spent the rest of the hour re tooling the lexicon back to mine-   delve into blah blah blah</p></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n</div>","author":"MDG","siteTitle":"Mark Ghuneim","siteHash":"fbdbfb355dab5247b3a3d9c04401313e99252873a1ae0fb1ea729c2e5736c6f3","entryHash":"dfeacff2b7edbb9d7d7be18e7e2118fedb16e70ca435e5bde3006e40d9af480e","category":"default"}
