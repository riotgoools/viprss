We didn’t have a gaming system in my house growing up — I had to settle going over to my friend Steve’s house for Atari 2600 and my big city cousins’ Intellivision — but we did have a couple of these handheld games. Specifically: <a href=\"https://www.electronicplastic.com/game/?id=355\">Baseball</a> (upper right), <a href=\"https://www.electronicplastic.com/game/?id=360\">Football 2</a> (lower left), and <a href=\"https://www.electronicplastic.com/game/?id=628\">Q*bert</a> (lower right). The football game was my favorite. I played it for hours and hours — so many touchdowns. (And look at <a href=\"https://www.electronicplastic.com/list/?search=madein:USSR\">these Soviet handhelds</a>!)</p>\n\n<p>Friends at school had other games: I particularly remember <a href=\"https://www.electronicplastic.com/list/?search=type:W\">the watches</a>, some of the <a href=\"https://www.electronicplastic.com/list/?company=coleco\">mini arcade cabinets from Coleco</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.electronicplastic.com/list/?company=nintendo\">these pre-Game Boy Nintendo handhelds</a>. The teachers hated them…I think they probably got banned at some point.</p>\n\n<p>I know that my dad still has these games stashed somewhere in the house I grew up in…I’d love to play Football 2 again. 🤖🏈 (via <a href=\"https://www.presentandcorrect.com/\">present and correct</a>)</p>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/video%20games\">video games</a></p>\n\n         <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/05/electronic-plastic\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"574e7490fff164ac975426112bb4166bfb7dc0fcf1aa6b53b5bb61f4844634ff","category":"default"}
