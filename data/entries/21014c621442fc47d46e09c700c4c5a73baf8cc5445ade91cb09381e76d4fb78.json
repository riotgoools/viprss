But It’s Great.</a></p>\n\n<blockquote><p>The D.M.V. is a beacon of equality in this country. Celebrate the place where you can watch a celebrity fill out the same forms that you do. We should revel in the fact that there is no express lane for beautiful, rich people to renew their licenses. When you sit in those hard chairs waiting for your number to appear on a screen, you should be delighted that no one else is sitting in a cushier chair. Look around that room and see your fellow Americans, the huddled masses, gathered at the feet of a woman asking for the paperwork to be a law-abiding citizen.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>She also adds that “The D.M.V. is one of the few places where privileged people — especially privileged white people — will ever encounter a woman of color with unquestionable authority.”</p>\n\n<p>Long-time readers of the site know what I’m gonna reference next: <a href=\"https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/news/a15636/whitewater-flash-pass-12403562/\">Tom Junod’s 2012 piece in Esquire</a> about <a href=\"https://kottke.org/13/07/waiting-in-line-as-american-as-apple-pie\">lines at amusement parks</a> and the advent of “Flash Passes” that help you skip the line:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>It sounds like an innovative answer to the problem that everybody faces at an amusement park, and one perfectly in keeping with the approaches currently in place at airports and even on some crowded American highways — perfectly in keeping with the two-tiering of America. You can pay for one level of access, or you can pay for another. If you have the means, you can even pay for freedom. There’s only one problem: Cutting the line is cheating, and everyone knows it. Children know it most acutely, know it in their bones, and so when they’ve been waiting on a line for a half-hour and a family sporting yellow plastic Flash Passes on their wrists walks up and steps in front of them, they can’t help asking why that family has been permitted the privilege of perpetrating what looks like an obvious injustice. And then you have to explain not just that they paid for it but that you haven’t paid enough — that the $100 or so that you’ve ponied up was just enough to teach your children that they are second- or third-class citizens.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>There’s no Flash Pass at the DMV.
