Air hired me to appear in their latest ad campaign, so I thought I’d write a little bit about what it was like!</em></h5><p>Last weekend I flew to Brooklyn to appear in an ad campaign with the most in-demand social media star today: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/itztherealrizzler/\">the Rizzler</a>.</p><p>The Rizzler is a third grader in New Jersey named Christian, who shot to fame after a <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Czgnn5sriji/\">video of him dressed as Black Panther</a> went viral on Instagram. He’s a key figure in the Costco Guys universe, a bizarre online world revolving around <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/a.j.andbigjustice/\">a father-son duo</a> from Florida, who have made a name for themselves with their Costco-centric content (more on them in a future post). The Rizzler regularly collaborates with them, but he is not blood related to them as many think. He’s still just a typical kid who happened to blow up online. Kind of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/21/style/corn-kid-tariq-tiktok.html\">similar to the corn kid</a> a couple years ago. </p><div><div><a href=\"https://instagram.com/itztherealrizzler\" target=\"_blank\">itztherealrizzler</a></div><a href=\"https://instagram.com/p/C58wEoULGak\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_640,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F__ss-rehost__IG-meta-C58wEoULGak.jpg\" /></a><div><div>A post shared by <a href=\"https://instagram.com/itztherealrizzler\" target=\"_blank\">@itztherealrizzler</a></div></div></div><p>Christian’s charm lies in his blend of humor, confidence, and signature “rizz face”—a Zoolander-like expression that’s earned him half a million Instagram followers. <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/itztherealrizzler/\">His account</a>, run by his dad, is full of family-friendly videos of Christian joking around and being himself. When I asked him how he felt about his viral fame, he just laughed and said he’s having a blast. </p><p>Despite his rising stardom, Christian’s dad says his son's life hasn’t changed much. There are occasional trips to New York for things like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8EI-NU_Y8Q\">a Barstool Sports podcast</a> appearance or to be the <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DA4lFiFR4LT/\">guest of honor at a Knicks game</a>, but Christian still goes to the same school and hangs out with his friends.</p><p>“Most of his fan base is high schoolers,” his dad told me. “But in his class, he’s just Christian.” </p><p>His dad said he has no long term plans for Christian's online career. He said that he wants his son to be happy and if Christian doesn't want to do something he never has to. If he ever wants to quit the content world, that is fine with his father. So far he's just letting his son enjoy all the fun opportunities that have come with his online attention while still keeping his suburban NJ life relatively normal.</p><p>The chance to meet the Rizzler came through <a href=\"https://air.inc/\">Air</a>, a platform that's like Dropbox but for creative people. The platform makes it easier to organize, approve, and share media. They call themselves “a visual workspace for creative teams.” I became interested in Air because the brand is very good at grabbing people’s attention online, it seemed like they think about content from the perspective of people who actually consume it and were down to lean into personality, humor, and creativity.</p><p>Air hired the Rizzler to star in <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DBOkIYDJYWo/\">the ad</a>, which had no script—just the Rizzler playing basketball and goofing off with comedian Kareem Rahma, who’s Air’s Chief Imagination Officer, both dressed as Steve Jobs. New York Nico played the director and I was <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DBO4njqJ0nP/\">cast to play an obnoxious journalist who couldn’t stop interrupting</a>. You can check out <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DBOkIYDJYWo\">the main ad</a> below and the <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DBO4njqJ0nP\">secondary one</a> we made together. </p><div><div><a href=\"https://instagram.com/kareem\" target=\"_blank\">kareem</a></div><a href=\"https://instagram.com/p/DBOkIYDJYWo\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_640,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F__ss-rehost__IG-meta-DBOkIYDJYWo.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" /></a><div><div>A post shared by <a href=\"https://instagram.com/kareem\" target=\"_blank\">@kareem</a></div></div></div><p>Working with Air, I was basically <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DBO4njqJ0nP/\">playing a heightened version of myself</a>. I was paid to be there as a content creator along with Nico and Kareem, but the whole thing was a giant improv exercise. I’ve been following Air’s marketing for a while, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/C9ztjusptFx/\">especially their work with Kareem</a>, and when Ariel Rubin, Air’s head of content, pitched me the idea, I could not have said yes faster. Ariel gets how weird and intense it can be to be a creative person today, how we’re all juggling personal brands and online personas, and how absurd it can feel.</p><p>After the shoot wrapped we <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DBJjIDBPtEv/\">grabbed sandwiches in Williamsburg</a>. Christian was excitedly talking about school and Halloween and how much he loves salami. He and his friends who came along to the shoot to hang out spent the afternoon playing with stickers from the shop. It was one of those perfect fall days in New York. Working on creative projects can be stressful, lonely, and exhausting. But collaborating with Nico, Kareem, and the Air team reminded me of how much fun it can be to make things for the internet with your friends. </p><div><div><div><p>User Mag is a reader-supported publication.

No, they will not. </h3><p>I loved every word of <a href=\"https://www.webworm.co/p/dumbphone\">this entire piece</a> by Elle Hunt in David Farrier’s Webworm, but especially these lines:</p><blockquote><p>Ultimately, as much as we might like to point the finger at tech and imagine we’d be better off without it, we are entirely in charge of how we use it, and how much we let it derail us day-to-day.</p><p>Instead of reaching for bans, laws and new, “dumb” devices to address the problems we’re experiencing with our online lives, it seems to me that we need to give ourselves more credit, and bolster our sense of autonomy.</p><p>Deleting TikTok or Instagram or X might give you more time.
