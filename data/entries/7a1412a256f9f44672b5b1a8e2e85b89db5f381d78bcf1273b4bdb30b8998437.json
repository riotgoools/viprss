{"title":"Brian Eno&#8217;s Glowing Turntable","link":"https://kottke.org/24/02/brian-enos-glowing-turntable","date":1707852886000,"content":"\n        <p><img src=\"/plus/misc/images/eno-glow-turntable-01.jpg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" alt=\"Brian Eno holding his glowing turntable in a dark room\" /></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/plus/misc/images/eno-glow-turntable-02.jpg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" alt=\"a turntable glowing in a dark room\" /></p>\n\n<p>Electronic music pioneer Brian Eno has designed <a href=\"https://www.paulstolper.com/exhibitions/101-brian-eno-turntable-ii-2024/overview/\">a glowing turntable that shifts colors as plays records</a>.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>Brian Enoâ€™s Turntable II is made up of a platter and base, which change colours independently, seamlessly phasing through combinations of generative â€˜colourscapesâ€™. The pattern of lights, the speed at which they change and how they change are programmed, but programmed to change randomly and slowly. It plays both 33 and 45rpm vinyl.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Only 150 will be sold and <a href=\"https://www.paulstolper.com/exhibitions/101/works/artworks-83926-brian-eno-turntable-ii-2024/\">theyâ€™re Â£20,000</a> so hopefully youâ€™ll see one in a museum someday.
