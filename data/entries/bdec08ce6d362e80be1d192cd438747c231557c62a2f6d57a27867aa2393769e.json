It’s a short game / net art piece / narrative vignette thing heavily inspired by <a href=\"http://art.teleportacia.org/olia.html\">Olia Lialina’s work</a>, but more likely to fail. I think this is a more special piece (with more of myself in it) and a nice testimony to a form of web work I have been experimenting with for a while, although obviously imperfect. I think it’s actually decently dense, or maybe it’s nothing. It’s a return to some of my more verbose interactive fiction works if you liked those, though I have never been a good writer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I will explain more about it when the aftermath of the making hurts less… but maybe you should see it for yourself. See you soon</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"605\" src=\"https://chias.blog/wp-content/uploads/image-26-1-1024x605.png\" srcset=\"https://chias.blog/wp-content/uploads/image-26-1-1024x605.png 1024w, https://chias.blog/wp-content/uploads/image-26-1-300x177.png 300w, https://chias.blog/wp-content/uploads/image-26-1-768x454.png 768w, https://chias.blog/wp-content/uploads/image-26-1-1536x908.png 1536w, https://chias.blog/wp-content/uploads/image-26-1-620x367.png 620w, https://chias.blog/wp-content/uploads/image-26-1.png 1793w\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://whenwe.love/moving\">Play (whenwe.love/moving)</a><br /><a href=\"https://chi.itch.io/moving\">Notice it on itch.io</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A dream sequence.<br />An ever-shifting poem of found images and objects, of infinite structure and worlds, of form and boundary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>( ~15k words, ~15 mins, ??? configurations )</p>\n\n\n\n<p>( Play in desktop / Chrome,  dual monitors / browsing other websites might break it.
