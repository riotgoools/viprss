{"title":"The Native Youth Olympics","link":"https://kottke.org/24/05/the-native-youth-olympics","date":1714667207000,"content":"\n        <p>Since the early 70s, the <a href=\"https://nyogames.com/\">Native Youth Olympics</a> have showcased the traditional games of the Alaska Native people:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>Our Alaska Native ancestors developed traditional games in order to test and prove crucial abilities that governed everyday life. Competition was created with each other to hone their ability to hunt and fish for daily survival in the traditional way of life. The creators of the NYO Games wanted an opportunity to demonstrate their favorite traditional Native contests of their forefathers.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>I found out about this via a highlight reel on Instagram — here’s last year’s competition highlights:</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>You can check out <a href=\"https://nyogames.com/nyo-events/\">a list of the competitive events</a>; they include:</p>\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAehvp7SdcA\">One-foot High Kick</a>: “In many cultures, the One-Foot High Kick was used for signaling a successful hunt.”</li>\n\n<p><li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqTzD9nIRFM\">Indian Stick Pull</a>: “The Indian Stick Pull represents grabbing a slippery salmon, and was used traditionally to develop hand and arm strength.”</li></p>\n\n<p><li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gW8qyJJrtdA\">Kneel Jump</a>: “Historically, the Kneel Jump was a game used to strengthen the leg muscles for jumping from ice floe to ice floe, and for lifting prey after a successful hunt.”</li></p>\n\n<p><li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6l27wrMPZ4\">Seal Hop</a>: “The Seal Hop is a variation of the Inuit Knuckle Hop, and used traditionally as a game of endurance and stamina, and for sneaking up on a seal, mimicking the mammal’s movement on the ice.”</li></p>\n\n<p><li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWpiu1H8SrU\">Two-foot High Kick</a>: “The Two-Foot High Kick was historically used to communicate the success of a spring hunt.”</li></p></ul><p></p>\n\n<p>I love these events. I think my favorite is a reintroduced event for the 2024 games (just concluded): the Toe Kick, which returned <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lC5vm_6ged0\">after a 10-year hiatus</a>. Here’s how you do it:</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>Here’s a short documentary about the NYO and athlete Autumn Ridley from 2013 — her event is the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBzsFd7sOws\">Alaskan High Kick</a>, perhaps the most impressively athletic event:</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Native%20Americans\">Native Americans</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/sports\">sports</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/video\">video</a></p>\n\n         <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/05/the-native-youth-olympics\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"ced39fc243af46ab7c803ec5852a63ecdbf9763e983922ddc006ac8a511e94a5","category":"default"}
