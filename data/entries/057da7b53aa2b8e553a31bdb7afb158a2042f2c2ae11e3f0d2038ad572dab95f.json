or, your capacity to get another job. that is: <em>your resume. your network. your credentials.</em> </p><p>but when you work for yourself, where do you source that feeling of security from? is it… a certain amount of cash reserves in the bank? the promise of future work and income streams? some kinds of insurance? professional relationships for getting referrals? good metrics? a large audience base, and the possibility of being able to sell something to them — and support your life in doing so? </p><p>all of these external things definitely make a difference. from my own experience, I know that there IS a huge difference between the feeling of having a financial cushion — and not. numbers make us feel things. numbers allow the body and nervous system — to exhale. </p><p>but, at the end of it, safety is<em> </em>still just a feeling. a felt sense. an internal state. it is your nervous system feeling regulated enough to stop running, and maybe, take a nap. or a whole day off. it is your body telling your mind: <em>you can relax, and you won’t die.</em> or: <em>you can share this thing you wrote, and no one will hate you for it. <br /><br /></em>but, before we go further, I first want to distinguish between <strong>safety</strong> <strong>and</strong> <strong>security</strong>. they are not the same thing.  <br /><br /><br /><br /></p><h1>security is a story</h1><p>security is a sense of guarantee. a promise. my mother — like most chinese mothers — is obsessed with security. an employment contract, a distinguished resume, health insurance — these are forms of <em>security</em> — there to catch you, if you trip. a corporate ladder is security. <em>if you climb this, you will be safe.</em> </p><p>for me, there is a sense of security in knowing that if I were incapable of making money in my business, I <em>could</em> always go out and get a job. this is 100% a belief, not a fact.<em> </em>my cash reserves in the bank are also a form of security. it’s a narrative I tell myself: <em>that</em> <em>if all else fails and I’m unable to work, I still have the resources to take care of myself.</em> </p><p>but these are both stories I tell myself — in order <em>to</em> feel safe. in truth, security is <em>never</em> 100% guaranteed. something terrible could happen and our lives could crumble, dissipate, and disappear at any moment. what once gave us security — a marriage, a job title, stock and bonds — could stop feeling safe. </p><p><strong>security can evaporate the moment we stop believing in it.</strong> </p><p><br /><br /></p><h1>safety is a felt sense</h1><p>safety is something different. safety is a state of being; a moment to moment experience of <em>feeling</em> safe. it is an embodied knowing. if you <em>feel</em> safe when you think about your work and the people you work with, and by that, I mean in a deep, embodied way — then chances are, you <em>are</em> safe. the whole purpose of security — with its stories, promises, and guarantees — is to concoct this feeling of safety. </p><p>theoretically, you could lose all forms of security — your job, all your money in the bank — and still maintain (albeit with challenges) the feeling of safety. you might have a support network, or personal conviction, or invincible faith that somehow, life will open a way for you.</p><p>safety is a feeling that you inhabit and live in. safety always exists in the moment, and the string of moments across days, weeks, and months — that lead you to say: <em>yes, I’m in a good place.</em> </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure>\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/51e8148de4b01c1eb79c1977/cc6c8f5d-b66b-40ee-91e6-c19657d46e31/business_as_safety_8-25-2.jpg?format=1000w\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1600\" srcset=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/51e8148de4b01c1eb79c1977/cc6c8f5d-b66b-40ee-91e6-c19657d46e31/business_as_safety_8-25-2.jpg?format=100w 100w, https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/51e8148de4b01c1eb79c1977/cc6c8f5d-b66b-40ee-91e6-c19657d46e31/business_as_safety_8-25-2.jpg?format=300w 300w, https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/51e8148de4b01c1eb79c1977/cc6c8f5d-b66b-40ee-91e6-c19657d46e31/business_as_safety_8-25-2.jpg?format=500w 500w, https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/51e8148de4b01c1eb79c1977/cc6c8f5d-b66b-40ee-91e6-c19657d46e31/business_as_safety_8-25-2.jpg?format=750w 750w, https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/51e8148de4b01c1eb79c1977/cc6c8f5d-b66b-40ee-91e6-c19657d46e31/business_as_safety_8-25-2.jpg?format=1000w 1000w, https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/51e8148de4b01c1eb79c1977/cc6c8f5d-b66b-40ee-91e6-c19657d46e31/business_as_safety_8-25-2.jpg?format=1500w 1500w, https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/51e8148de4b01c1eb79c1977/cc6c8f5d-b66b-40ee-91e6-c19657d46e31/business_as_safety_8-25-2.jpg?format=2500w 2500w\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption>\n            <p>my personal scale of feeling safe to unsafe </p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <h1><br />why does work sometimes feel unsafe? </h1><p><br />recently, I’ve been writing about business as <a href=\"https://keningzhu.com/journal/business-as-honoring-creative-energy\" target=\"_blank\">the exchange of energy</a> between you and the world. when you see it that way — <strong>as a relationship of reciprocal giving and receiving</strong> — not unlike a friendship or romantic relationship — then it makes sense why this relationship could trigger a lot of feelings of <em>un</em>-safety. </p><p>in between you and “the other” — is the thing you create: <em>your work.</em> </p><p><strong><br />work as childhood conditioned self-worth</strong></p><p>I’ve observed a lot of work trauma as rooted in relationships to our efforts in childhood. our relationship to work is tied to ways in which we felt safe and able to express our creativity, or not. </p><p>from a young age, we’re conditioned to equate our work to self-worth — <span>trying</span> hard enough and <span>doing</span> enough became inextricably tangled with the notion of <span><em>being</em></span> enough.</p><p>we observed which things we received validation, recognition, and approval for — and which things were discouraged, chastised, or ignored. if our expressions of creativity triggered our parents’ anxiety and insecurity (of the possibility of us becoming starving artists), then we received a message that it was unsafe to be creative. </p><p>as children, whatever conditioned responses of fear we experienced are all based on the rubric of the adults that surrounded us. and no matter how far we’ve gone now, to some extent, they’re still playing in the backrooms of our psyches. <br /></p><p><strong>dysfunctional relationship dynamics &amp; not knowing what safe fels like</strong></p><p>the other way that work can feel triggering and unsafe is if you’ve experienced dysfunctional relationship dynamics in your life — non-reciprocal relationships, where you didn’t feel acknowledged, seen, or heard; where you fell into patterns of  prioritizing the needs of another while overriding your own. these responses inevitably cross over to your professional life. </p><p>I’ll tell you my own personal experience. I used to think that I had an usually high risk tolerance, combined with a good measure of obstinate self-conviction — thus, I was able to take big leaps without feeling paralyzed by fear. </p><p>this is true. but looking back, I also realized one crucial thing. for many years, I didn’t value safety — in my personal or professional life — because I actually didn’t know what “being safe” felt like. safety was a foreign feeling. in those years, I had a very hard time distinguishing between what’s <em>safe </em>vs.<em> unsafe. </em></p><p><em>real </em>safety felt unsafe — like a trap, because I wasn’t used to it. what was unsafe felt like a sticky, irresistable flower —<em> </em>in that it made me feel alive.<em> </em>this is how<em> </em>I got myself into a series of romantic relationships where I felt unseen and diminished, while constantly trying to prove my self-worth. it took me a long time to even clock that I didn’t feel safe — otherwise, I would’ve done something about it earlier.  </p><p>I’m in a different place in my life now — and in a partnership where I feel a deeply embodied sense of safety. <a href=\"https://keningzhu.com/journal/the-feeling-of-being-safe\">a safety without words</a>. it’s taught me to recognize safety when I see it — and to cherish it. </p><h1><br /><br />safety in the container of relationship</h1><p>so, safety is a feeling — a felt sense. </p><p>and: <strong>safety is experienced (or not) within the container of relationships</strong> — not just with a person, but in a situation, a place, or environment — physical or psychological. </p><p>when you have your own business, you’re navigating a more complex web of relationships than just with your boss, co-workers, and the work itself. </p><p>of course, <strong>first and foremost, you’re dealing with yourself:</strong> your creativity, your energy, your time, your sense of self-worth. </p><p>then, you’re also dancing with the abstracted “other” — <em>that is, the “public” / internet strangers / acquaintances / your “audience,” </em>as well as with clients, customers, and the people in your community. </p><p>and then, you have your relationship to the work itself: your offerings and ecosystems, your business systems and containers, and — your relationship with money. </p><p><strong>work is about exchanging resources.</strong> </p><p>and money is just another resource on this list. </p><p>feeling safe is therefore about <strong>cultivating</strong> <strong>safety in relationship to your resources — and the people with whom you exchange them.</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure>\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/51e8148de4b01c1eb79c1977/ed5acf3e-a656-49eb-9e1f-a59a7edfe999/business_as_safety_8-25-4.jpg?format=1000w\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1600\" srcset=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/51e8148de4b01c1eb79c1977/ed5acf3e-a656-49eb-9e1f-a59a7edfe999/business_as_safety_8-25-4.jpg?format=100w 100w, https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/51e8148de4b01c1eb79c1977/ed5acf3e-a656-49eb-9e1f-a59a7edfe999/business_as_safety_8-25-4.jpg?format=300w 300w, https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/51e8148de4b01c1eb79c1977/ed5acf3e-a656-49eb-9e1f-a59a7edfe999/business_as_safety_8-25-4.jpg?format=500w 500w, https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/51e8148de4b01c1eb79c1977/ed5acf3e-a656-49eb-9e1f-a59a7edfe999/business_as_safety_8-25-4.jpg?format=750w 750w, https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/51e8148de4b01c1eb79c1977/ed5acf3e-a656-49eb-9e1f-a59a7edfe999/business_as_safety_8-25-4.jpg?format=1000w 1000w, https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/51e8148de4b01c1eb79c1977/ed5acf3e-a656-49eb-9e1f-a59a7edfe999/business_as_safety_8-25-4.jpg?format=1500w 1500w, https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/51e8148de4b01c1eb79c1977/ed5acf3e-a656-49eb-9e1f-a59a7edfe999/business_as_safety_8-25-4.jpg?format=2500w 2500w\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <h1>what makes you feel safe? </h1><p>for me, safety is tied to a sense of expansive freedom — at the same time as feeling consistent cared for, and listened to.
