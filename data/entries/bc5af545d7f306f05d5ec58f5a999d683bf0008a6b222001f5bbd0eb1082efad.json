Here's the deal. When I write a blog post and want to know if anyone has mentioned it, I will simply be able to ask ChatGPT, \"Have any sites mentioned, with or without links, the story I wrote yesterday entitled \"Unix-like things\" and if so please provide a title, synopsis and link, if available, so I can read the full text.\" I'm sure that will be appropriately shortened, or perhaps turned into something like the referrer lists of today.
