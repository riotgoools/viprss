{"title":"Phil and Phyllis Punxsutawney Had Babies","link":"https://kottke.org/24/03/phil-and-phyllis-punxsutawney-had-babies","date":1711650209000,"content":"\n        <p><a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/news/nation-world/punxsutawney-phil-wife-phyllis-baby-groundhog-family-20240327.html\">Punxsutawney Phil and his mate Phyllis have had babies</a> and both of the articles I read about this deeply weirded me out. Listen, I get it, you don’t get to be President of <a href=\"https://www.groundhog.org\">The Punxsutawney Groundhog Club</a> Inner Circle by being normal about groundhogs, but it feels a little culty to me.</p>\n\n<p>To wit:<br />\n“[Dunkel] has a special cane that lets him speak “Groundhogease”.”</p>\n\n<p>“He added that Phil’s children will not inherit his seer of seers or prognosticator abilities because, simply, there’s only one Phil.” Bro, what? Why wouldn’t the children inherit the mirth?</p>\n\n<p>“[Phil] receives a special elixir to extend his life.” (Dunkel is at least better than the previous president <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/01/29/groundhog-peta-punxsutawney/\">who said in 2020 Phil was 134 years old</a>, able to live forever because of the elixir, while Dunkel smartly refused to age the groundhog. (wood)Chuck Everlasting imo.)</p>\n\n<p>The article says groundhogs don’t mate in captivity, but I can’t find proof of that one way or another. That said, this is the first time in the 138 year history of the PGC the groundhogs have mated. Finally, the Inner Circle is, of course, all men, though the Executive Director of the PGC is a woman and appears to have honorary membership on this honorary council.</p>\n\n<p>Because I like using blog posts as opportunities for learning new stuff I said to myself while I was writing this post, “I bet people would find it helpful if I told them what the difference between a groundhog and a woodchuck is,” because it seems like the kind of thing people would want to know and I always thought they were the same thing, but I’m also the dumb bitch who just found out last night whales used to walk around land and evolved from land mammals so I googled it, and yeah, no, woodchucks and groundhogs are the same thing. I was right about that one. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groundhog_Day_(film)\"><blockquote><p>When Chekhov saw the long winter, he saw a winter bleak and dark and bereft of hope. Yet we know that winter is just another step in the cycle of life. But standing here among the people of Punxsutawney and basking in the warmth of their hearths and hearts, I couldn’t imagine a better fate than a long and lustrous winter.</p></blockquote></a></p>\n\n<p>(via <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/igallupd.bsky.social/post/3koqxlovc6f2l\">@igallupd.bsky.social</a>)</p>\n\n <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/animals\">animals</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Groundhog%20Day\">Groundhog Day</a></p>\n\n <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/03/phil-and-phyllis-punxsutawney-had-babies\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Aaron Cohen","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"03bd37e37e1f2b7839f7a5058269f0389b6d40ba0fbe8590e1d50dc4c0d93b23","category":"default"}
