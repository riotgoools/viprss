{"title":"NYT just stop podcast","link":"http://scripting.com/2024/07/21/125022.html?title=nytJustStopPodcast","date":1721566222000,"content":"<p><img src=\"https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/07/04/butHerEmails.png\" />A two-minute <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2024/07/21/nytSayYourSorryAndGetBackToNews.m4a\">podcast</a> where I dictate an op-ed the NYT should run in its own name, apologizing for trying to take over the US government, and promising to return to being a news organization. </p>\n<p>I am so fed up with it. Today they ran an op-ed written by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Sorkin\">Aaron Sorkin</a> giving advice to Democrats based on his experience writing scripts for a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_West_Wing\">fictional White House</a> in the late 90s and early 00s. </p>\n<p>Yeah the NYT has lost its way. I hope some people down there think they're way out on a limb and it's time to get back to what they do. They are not qualified or entitled to do what they are doing.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"51ccd8fbf9829ed2249e401bf1554179032f5a91501abcbb3f1c10fab9342c90","category":"default"}
