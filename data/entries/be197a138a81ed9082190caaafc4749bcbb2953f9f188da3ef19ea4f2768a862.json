One of the major themes of the show is that the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylons\">robots</a> that the Capricans created went to war with the humans and almost but not quite wiped them out. Almost every episode is about the conflict between humans and the AIs. It's a fantastic show, the acting and the writing is far beyond most TV series. I'm at the beginning of season 3. I'll let you know if I figure anything out from watching the series again.","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"be197a138a81ed9082190caaafc4749bcbb2953f9f188da3ef19ea4f2768a862","category":"default"}
