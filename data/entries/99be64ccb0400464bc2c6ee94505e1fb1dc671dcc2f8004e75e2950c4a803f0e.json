{"title":"13.9 percent less democracy?","link":"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/900018458/0/marginalrevolution~percent-less-democracy.html","date":1719291937000,"content":"<p>Estonian edition:</p>\r\n<blockquote><p>After the Citizenship Act was enacted in 1992, 90% of ethnic-Estonians automatically became citizens while only 8-10% of non-Estonians gained citizenship. This is due to a law that granted citizenship to those who were living in Estonia before 1940, which was the year of Soviet annexation. [3] Because of the law, those that moved or were born in Estonia after 1940 during Soviet times had to apply for citizenship. New numbers show that ‘as of April 2012, 93,774 persons (6.9% of the population) remain stateless, while approximately 95,115 (7% of the population) have chosen Russian citizenship as an alternative to statelessness’. [4] Because many Russian-speakers have not been able to gain citizenship, this combined 13.9% of the population does not have the right to participate in Estonian democracy.</p></blockquote>\r\n<p>Here is <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://thesecuritydistillery.org/all-articles/baltic-security-an-inward-look-at-ethnic-tension-in-estonia-and-its-threat-to-democracy\" target=\"_blank\">more detail</a>.  I believe in 1992, during the first election, about forty percent of the resident, age-relevant population was not eligible to vote.  I am not sure what the percentages are right now, but I do know the same basic system continues.</p>\r\n<p>I do not <em>per se</em> object to these policies (fear the Russian bear), while noting I do not have enough information to assess all the trade-offs involved.  Nonetheless it is interesting how much attention the Hungarian and Polish democratic “deviations” receive, relative to this one.  An EU country in fully good standing around the world, on the basis of ethnicity, denies a significant portion of its longstanding residents the right to vote.</p>\r\n<p>Two further points. First, you have to worry about this issue, as a Russian ethnic, unless your ancestors arrived before 1940.  So the worry here is not just about recent arrivals, but it is quite possible that your grandparents were born in Estonia, maybe even great-grandparents.  Second, ethnic Russians do have a path to normal Estonian citizenship, but it is difficult, especially the language requirement, which I am told is very tough.</p>\r\n<p>I heard Russian a great deal walking through the streets of Tallinn, and most of all at the ballet.  I have seen estimates that one-quarter of the Estonian population is ethnic Russian, and in the major city it is surely more than that.</p>\r\n<p>Garett Jones, <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.amazon.com/10-Less-Democracy-Should-Elites/dp/1503603571/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1VEWB9S2WV1RJ&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.Z52XZAdUqMc1woMxMRxAZA.JLykUkqAi0auEL157h2uBk1RoNMHCtSp9kdyrBPnbik&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=garrett+jones+ten+percent+less+democracy&amp;qid=1719253271&amp;sprefix=garett+jones+ten+percent+less+democracy%2Caps%2C207&amp;sr=8-1\" target=\"_blank\">telephone</a>!</p>\r\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/06/13-9-percent-less-democracy.html\">13.9 percent less democracy?</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com\">Marginal REVOLUTION</a>.</p>\r\n<img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/900018458/0/marginalrevolution\" />\r\n<div><a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/900018458/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/900018458/marginalrevolution,\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/900018458/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/x.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/900018458/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/900018458/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/06/13-9-percent-less-democracy.html#comments\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/comments20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/06/13-9-percent-less-democracy.html/feed\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/commentsrss20.png\" /></a> \r\n<div><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/06/13-9-percent-less-democracy.html#comments\"><h3>Comments</h3></a><ul><li><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/06/13-9-percent-less-democracy.html#comment-160772986\">In reply to EdR.
