{"title":"James Ledbetter, R.I.P.","link":"https://om.co/2024/10/31/james-ledbetter-r-i-p/","date":1730396538000,"content":"<p>James Ledbetter, one of my contemporaries from the world of business journalism, has died at age 60. Inc. magazine <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.inc.com/graham-winfrey/james-ledbetter-former-editor-in-chief-of-inc-dies-at-60/90993991\">reported</a> he died of a heart attack. Ledbetter had worked for most major media publications and was deeply connected in the media world. I never met Ledbetter, who was the New York bureau chief of The Industry Standard, the seminal magazine that epitomized the dot-com bubble. I worked for Red Herring, which itself was a poster child of dot-com excess. Ledbetter wrote “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1586481290\"><em>Starving to Death on $200 Million</em></a><em>: The Short, Absurd Life of The Industry Standard,” </em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://om.co/2015/03/01/bookstolearnaboutechhistory/\">a book that is a must-read</a> for all students of history, bubbles and, of course, technology. RIP.</p>","author":"Om Malik","siteTitle":"Om Malik","siteHash":"56aa7c22de1a9e5680d03082a2a13db78fe214c96b8119e8d54042cbf2d355ae","entryHash":"ca8c9989c69ab927fecb47670122f81b320d108a268764828ac07863fded086e","category":"Sites"}
