This may seem inevitable — because to love is always to see the divine in each other, because <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2024/01/03/christian-wiman-love/\">all love is a yearning for the sacred</a>, within us and between us. And yet the moment we cast the other as our savior, our redeemer, the arbiter of our significance, we have ceased loving — for we have ceased seeing the living human being. </p>\n<figure><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/the-heart-of-the-rose-by-elihu-vedder-1891-1892_print?curator=brainpicker\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/ElihuVedder_TheHeartOfTheRose_TheMarginalian.jpg?resize=680%2C678&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"680\" height=\"678\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/ElihuVedder_TheHeartOfTheRose_TheMarginalian.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/ElihuVedder_TheHeartOfTheRose_TheMarginalian.jpg?resize=320%2C319&amp;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/ElihuVedder_TheHeartOfTheRose_TheMarginalian.jpg?resize=600%2C598&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/ElihuVedder_TheHeartOfTheRose_TheMarginalian.jpg?resize=240%2C239&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/ElihuVedder_TheHeartOfTheRose_TheMarginalian.jpg?resize=768%2C765&amp;ssl=1 768w\" /></a><figcaption><em>The Heart of the Rose</em> by Elihu Vedder, 1891.

We have suffered in the same way across cultures and civilizations, and have transmuted that singular, commonplace suffering into some of our most enduring works of art. (“You think your pain and your heartbreak are unprecedented in the history of the world,” James Baldwin observed in <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2017/05/24/james-baldwin-life-magazine-1963/\">his finest interview</a>, “but then you read.”)</p>\n<p>Centuries ago, <strong>John Donne</strong> (1572–1631) channeled the complex interplay between eros and the divine, the confusion of it and the transcendence of it, in the most eternal of his <em>Holy Sonnets</em>. Composed in his late thirties and published shortly after his death, it is read here by nineteen-year-old artist and poetry-lover <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqFGBHlWK1r4C0FGVTP4_5g\" target=\"_blank\">Rose Hanzlik</a> to the sound of Bach’s <em>Goldberg Variations</em>:</p>\n<p></p>\n<blockquote><p>Batter my heart, three-person’d God, for you<br />\nAs yet but knock, breathe, shine, and seek to mend;<br />\nThat I may rise and stand, o’erthrow me, and bend<br />\nYour force to break, blow, burn, and make me new.<br />\nI, like an usurp’d town to another due,<br />\nLabor to admit you, but oh, to no end;<br />\nReason, your viceroy in me, me should defend,<br />\nBut is captiv’d, and proves weak or untrue.<br />\nYet dearly I love you, and would be lov’d fain,<br />\nBut am betroth’d unto your enemy;<br />\nDivorce me, untie or break that knot again,<br />\nTake me to you, imprison me, for I,<br />\nExcept you enthrall me, never shall be free,<br />\nNor ever chaste, except you ravish me.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Complement with Derek Walcott’s lifeline of a poem <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2015/04/21/love-after-love-derek-walcott/\">“Love After Love,”</a> then revisit Aldous Huxley on <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2015/07/22/aldous-huxley-who-are-we-divine-within/\">reclaiming the divine within</a>.</p>\n<hr /><h3>donating = loving</h3><p>For seventeen years, I have been spending hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars each month composing <em>The Marginalian</em> (which <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2021/10/22/brain-pickings-becoming-the-marginalian/\">bore the outgrown name <em>Brain Pickings</em></a> for its first fifteen years).
