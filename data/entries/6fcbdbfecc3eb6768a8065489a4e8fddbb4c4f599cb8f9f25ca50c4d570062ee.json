I read today in the NYT that the resistance is exhausted. Bullshit. We're very well rested. The NYT is a den of assholes. They should explain themselves, or it's time to set up a receptacle for leaks from within so we can get the truth about who's selling us out to Trump inside the NYT so we know who to blame. Anyway I look forward to once again, pretending Trump doesn't exist.","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"6fcbdbfecc3eb6768a8065489a4e8fddbb4c4f599cb8f9f25ca50c4d570062ee","category":"default"}
