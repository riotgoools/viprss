{"title":"&#8216;The Examined Run&#8217; and Virtue in Athletics","link":"https://kottke.org/24/02/the-examined-run-and-virtue-in-athletics","date":1708635605000,"content":"\n        <p>It’s a little painful to me that a woman my own age is not only a philosophy professor and mother to two small children but also a long-distance runner who writes a thoughtful and affecting <a href=\"https://www.irunfar.com/on-perseverance-in-running-and-life\">online column</a> about all of the above. She — Sabrina Little — has a new book out about virtue in athletics, and while I am dying to hate the whole thing, I found her <a href=\"https://www.thehalfmarathoner.com/p/sabrina-little-on-living-the-examined\">interview with the running newsletter The Half Marathoner</a> to be inviting enough that I <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0197678696/ref=nosim/0sil8\">ordered the book</a>. Here’s one bit from the interview (I can’t tell if it sounds preachy out of context, but maybe I’ve just drunk too much of the Kool Aid): </p>\n\n<blockquote><p>I … found a special kinship between the work that I do in virtue ethics and in running. Virtues are acquired by practice. For example, we act courageously to develop courage, honestly to become honest, and so forth. In athletics, we have this same logic of ‘practice.’ We set out everyday in our sneakers to improve in certain respects — becoming faster, more courageous, more perseverant.\n\n</p><p>However, where character is concerned, if we are not intentional in our training, we may be developing the wrong things — imprudence, poor stewardship, intemperance, or impatience. These traits can impact our training, but also our lives outside of it. So, there is value in examining running as a formative practice. We should ask whether we are practicing being the kinds of people we want to be outside of the sport. </p><p></p>\n\n<p></p></blockquote>\n\n<p>The interview reminded me that my main goal in running is to continue to be able to run. It also reminded me, of course, of “<a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/01/0043747-you-should-try-running-ac\">You Should Try Running, According to Me, Your Friend Who Won’t Shut Up About Running</a>,” which is also a thoughtful and affecting read. </p>\n\n <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/books\">books</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/running\">running</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/sabrina%20little\">sabrina little</a></p>\n\n <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/02/the-examined-run-and-virtue-in-athletics\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Edith Zimmerman","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"00e78d5aa56d7e31da83a57b6581ee562a8e76a60883f7e447f50e69183b5d1b","category":"default"}
