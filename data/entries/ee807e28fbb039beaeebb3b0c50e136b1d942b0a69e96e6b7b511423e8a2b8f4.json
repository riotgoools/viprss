He had survived his kidnapping. But the actual kidnapping is not what this story is about, if you can believe it. Itâ€™s about surviving what you survived, which is also known as the rest of your life.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Itâ€™s also about, spoiler alert, trauma.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>Tolstoy tells us that all happy families are alike and that each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way. A few years ago, I wrote a different novel, my first novel, about divorce, which was inspired in part by the divorce stories of several people I know, and I came to the conclusion that, actually, all divorces are exactly alike. I tell you this because Iâ€™ve now come to understand the same thing about trauma: Happy, well-adjusted people are all different. The traumatized are exactly alike. Iâ€™m about to tell you a story that is nothing like a violent kidnapping â€” almost laughably so â€” but what Iâ€™ve learned over the years is that trauma is trauma. Something terrible happens, beyond what is in our own personal capacity to cope with, and the details donâ€™t matter as much as the state weâ€™re thrown into. Our bodies and brains have not evolved to reliably differentiate a rape at knife point from a job loss that threatens us with financial ruin or from the dismantling of our world by our parentsâ€™ divorce. Itâ€™s wrong, but explain that to your poor, battered autonomic nervous system.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Like I said, itâ€™s a great piece and you should <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/07/magazine/kidnapping-long-island.html?unlocked_article_code=1.Lk4.3RMV.-GDGReKA1XZg\">read the whole thing</a>.
