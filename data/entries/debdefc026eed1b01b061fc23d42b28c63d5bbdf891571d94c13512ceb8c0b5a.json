and what does she do, once she realizes there’s another version of her, out there?” </em>these are not the stakes. it doesn’t seem to matter. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure>\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/51e8148de4b01c1eb79c1977/db71cc9a-390b-4d4e-9ca3-21dffc5b7b55/Double-Life-of-Veronique_1.jpg?format=1000w\" width=\"1184\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/51e8148de4b01c1eb79c1977/db71cc9a-390b-4d4e-9ca3-21dffc5b7b55/Double-Life-of-Veronique_1.jpg?format=100w 100w, https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/51e8148de4b01c1eb79c1977/db71cc9a-390b-4d4e-9ca3-21dffc5b7b55/Double-Life-of-Veronique_1.jpg?format=300w 300w, https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/51e8148de4b01c1eb79c1977/db71cc9a-390b-4d4e-9ca3-21dffc5b7b55/Double-Life-of-Veronique_1.jpg?format=500w 500w, https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/51e8148de4b01c1eb79c1977/db71cc9a-390b-4d4e-9ca3-21dffc5b7b55/Double-Life-of-Veronique_1.jpg?format=750w 750w, https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/51e8148de4b01c1eb79c1977/db71cc9a-390b-4d4e-9ca3-21dffc5b7b55/Double-Life-of-Veronique_1.jpg?format=1000w 1000w, https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/51e8148de4b01c1eb79c1977/db71cc9a-390b-4d4e-9ca3-21dffc5b7b55/Double-Life-of-Veronique_1.jpg?format=1500w 1500w, https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/51e8148de4b01c1eb79c1977/db71cc9a-390b-4d4e-9ca3-21dffc5b7b55/Double-Life-of-Veronique_1.jpg?format=2500w 2500w\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p>instead, we’re simply invited to soak in and witness her life experience: her daily routines, tenuous romances, her intuitive awareness of the otherworld, and her unexplainable sorrows. it feels much more like prose poetry, than fiction — particularly in its magnificent use of color tones, light, music, and symbolic visual motifs. so many frames in this movie feel like paintings. you enter the interior spaces — her rooms, apartments, home, beds — with an unfolding quality that allows your entire psyche to inhabit them. I was there, with her, in every moment, fully seeing the world through her eyes. and: witnessing her. </p><p>the men in this film — and their romances with Véronique — all carry a quality of stranger-ness to them. there is a poetic distance; a distance which allows for even more intimacy and intrigue. there is minimal dialogue. so much is conveyed in the subtly of their expressions and movements, but left unsaid. then again, she is also an intimate stranger to us — and, a stranger to herself. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure>\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/51e8148de4b01c1eb79c1977/3cae0282-cf6d-4ced-a0f2-6573ea5a668b/Double-Life-of-Veronique_5.jpeg?format=1000w\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" srcset=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/51e8148de4b01c1eb79c1977/3cae0282-cf6d-4ced-a0f2-6573ea5a668b/Double-Life-of-Veronique_5.jpeg?format=100w 100w, https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/51e8148de4b01c1eb79c1977/3cae0282-cf6d-4ced-a0f2-6573ea5a668b/Double-Life-of-Veronique_5.jpeg?format=300w 300w, https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/51e8148de4b01c1eb79c1977/3cae0282-cf6d-4ced-a0f2-6573ea5a668b/Double-Life-of-Veronique_5.jpeg?format=500w 500w, https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/51e8148de4b01c1eb79c1977/3cae0282-cf6d-4ced-a0f2-6573ea5a668b/Double-Life-of-Veronique_5.jpeg?format=750w 750w, https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/51e8148de4b01c1eb79c1977/3cae0282-cf6d-4ced-a0f2-6573ea5a668b/Double-Life-of-Veronique_5.jpeg?format=1000w 1000w, https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/51e8148de4b01c1eb79c1977/3cae0282-cf6d-4ced-a0f2-6573ea5a668b/Double-Life-of-Veronique_5.jpeg?format=1500w 1500w, https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/51e8148de4b01c1eb79c1977/3cae0282-cf6d-4ced-a0f2-6573ea5a668b/Double-Life-of-Veronique_5.jpeg?format=2500w 2500w\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p>had I watched this film a decade ago, I might have found myself completely obsessed by the quality of its melancholic, poetic romanticism. it is, if anything, a portrait of a young woman, alone (yet not alone) in the world — where anything can happen to her: love, sex, beauty, life, and death. it is a portrait of fate, free-will, romance, synchronicities, and, ultimately, a mystical kind of female solitude. it is what I craved for so many years, all throughout my twenties. then, I lived it. now, I’ve seemed to moved onwards. </p><p>but, watching this film takes me back there — with a tenderness and recognition of that part of myself, which is still very much alive. watching this film, I had the keen awareness that it was made the year I was born (1991). I had a very strange feeling — as though I were watching my own mother. it made me imagine the textures of her interiorities, her sorrows, her romances, her longings — much before I was born. </p><p>at the end of it all, all I wished was for her to find happiness. in its lack of conclusiveness (it’s really not about the man), there is a deep realism to it. it’s poetic in the way that only life can be. like looking at old polaroids. afterwards, I felt imprinted — with polaroids of light shards, and colors, and the scent of a world that lingers in me — which makes the ordinary life feel, somehow, more sacred. </p><p></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n<hr /> ","author":"Kening Zhu","siteTitle":"kening zhu","siteHash":"ef8a94b9fc20c32a4ee7d94ee971337d278e8b2fafe747123e4eb5cea026e84e","entryHash":"debdefc026eed1b01b061fc23d42b28c63d5bbdf891571d94c13512ceb8c0b5a","category":"Sites"}
