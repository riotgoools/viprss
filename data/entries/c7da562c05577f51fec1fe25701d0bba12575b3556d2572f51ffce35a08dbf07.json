The series is over, the next game on Sunday will be against the winner in the west, either San Diego or Los Angeles. Last night's game was stressful, low scoring, until the Mets star shortstop hit a <a href=\"https://www.mlb.com/video/francisco-lindor-hits-a-grand-slam-1-to-center-field-starling-marte-score\">freaking</a> <i>grand slam</i> <a href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/francisco-lindor-sends-mets-to-the-nlcs-eliminates-phillies-with-grand-slam-in-nlds-game-4-035006801.html\">home run</a>, and that was all the scoring we needed. The Mets are the hottest team in baseball. It doesn't feel like a long time since <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_New_York_Mets_season\">2015</a> when they got to the World Series before crashing. Who knows how far we'll get this year, honestly -- I'm surprised (and pleased) we got this far. And in the meantime, I caught a tiny bit of last night's preseason game between the <a href=\"https://www.bulletsforever.com/2024/10/9/24266653/washington-wizards-new-york-knicks-nba-preseason-game-recap\">Knicks</a> and some other team I don't care about. They have two new stars to add to the roster after <a href=\"https://www.nba.com/news/isaiah-hartenstein-2024-free-agency\">losing one star</a> as a free agent, and trading two others for the <a href=\"https://www.nba.com/news/karl-anthony-towns-trade-knicks-timberwolves\">second new star</a>. All in all, very enticing. New York has some excellent sports teams, which is unusual, because it isn't just the Jankees this time, a team I will, I promise, <i>never</i> root for. Quite the opposite. I will root for whoever they are playing. You can probably tell I don't like them. <span>😄</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"c7da562c05577f51fec1fe25701d0bba12575b3556d2572f51ffce35a08dbf07","category":"Sites"}
