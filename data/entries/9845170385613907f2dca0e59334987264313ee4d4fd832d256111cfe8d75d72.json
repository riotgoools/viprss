I was worrying what ‘people would think’ of a decision I had made, and she said, “Amanda, There is no audience.”</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>The tweet went viral, so this probably isn’t news to a lot of readers. But I’ve been saying it to myself ever since: <em>Amanda, there is no audience.</em> Somehow, for a few seconds at a time, it makes sense to me on a very deep level. The “Amanda” part seems essential, too, for whatever reason. </p>\n\n <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Amanda%20Fortini\">Amanda Fortini</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/amanda%20there%20is%20no%20audience\">amanda there is no audience</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/creative%20processes\">creative processes</a></p>\n\n <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/04/amanda-there-is-no-audience\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Edith Zimmerman","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"9845170385613907f2dca0e59334987264313ee4d4fd832d256111cfe8d75d72","category":"default"}
