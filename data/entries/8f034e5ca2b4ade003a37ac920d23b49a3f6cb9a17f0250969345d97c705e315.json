Everyone should have <a href=\"https://this.how/commentGuidelines/\">one</a>. He's a bit of a troll himself. Once he gave a talk at an O'Reilly conference, and while I was in the audience, accused me of designing <a href=\"http://xmlrpc.com/\">XML-RPC</a> to get around firewalls. I happen to know that's not true, and in fact you can <i>easily</i> spec a firewall rule that keeps out XML-RPC calls, that was a design goal. So I waited my turn, and explained. He just stood there, offered no apology or retraction or explanation. Now that's fucked up Bruce. From that point on I never believed any of his proclamations. And I rarely forget people who openly trash my rep like that. Tech is so fucked up that way. People like Schneier take advantage of the fact that people don't understand the terminology so they get away with hurling insults randomly like that.","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"8f034e5ca2b4ade003a37ac920d23b49a3f6cb9a17f0250969345d97c705e315","category":"default"}
