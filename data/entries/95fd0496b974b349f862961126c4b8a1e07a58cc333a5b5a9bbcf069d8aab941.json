Once they’re caught, they’re chucked off of cliffs the next day and fly out to sea:</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2022/09/26/1124759293/puffling-season-iceland\">From NPR</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>Many residents of Vestmannaeyjar spend a few weeks in August and September collecting wayward pufflings that have crashed into town after mistaking human lights for the moon. Releasing the fledglings at the cliffs the following day sets them on the correct path.</p>\n\n<p>This human tradition has become vital to the survival of puffins, Rodrigo A. Martínez Catalán of Náttúrustofa Suðurlands [South Iceland Nature Research Center] told NPR. A pair of puffins – which mate for life – only incubate one egg per season and don’t lay eggs every year.</p>\n\n<p>“If you have one failed generation after another after another after another,” Catalán said, “the population is through, pretty much.”</p></blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-new-yorker-documentary/preparing-to-fly-in-puffling\">Jessica Bishopp’s meditative short film</a> follows a pair of teen girls and their friends as they drive around in the middle of the night collecting pufflings.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<blockquote><p>Interspersed with the puffling search are brief moments of the quotidian: we see Selma talking to her friends about acrylic nails and also braiding her younger sister’s hair. These scenes illustrate how the teens’ environmental action is only a part of a larger routine of caretaking, revealing a world in which environmental protection is both normal and necessary. “I think it’s important that we tell alternative stories of girlhood, and it’s not led by trauma or romance,” Bishopp said. The girls show themselves to be responsible stewards. They are also in the midst of their own coming of age, and they’re aware of the parallel between their own experiences and those of the birds, who are separating from their parents.</p></blockquote>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Iceland\">Iceland</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Jessica%20Bishopp\">Jessica Bishopp</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/video\">video</a></p>\n\n         <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/09/the-joyful-utility-of-yeeting-pufflings-off-cliffs\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"95fd0496b974b349f862961126c4b8a1e07a58cc333a5b5a9bbcf069d8aab941","category":"Sites"}
