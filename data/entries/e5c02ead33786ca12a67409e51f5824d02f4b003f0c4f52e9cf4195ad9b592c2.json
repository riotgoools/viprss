How incredibly insulting. It's just like what Trump says about Jewish Americans being loyal to Israel. Such an un-American idea. We all got here different ways. Some for a better life, some for life at all, others as slaves. But the United States is a big-hearted idea -- the <i>United</i> States. It's unfortunate that such a small-minded <i>dis</i>united person is so powerful now. We still have a long way to go.","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"e5c02ead33786ca12a67409e51f5824d02f4b003f0c4f52e9cf4195ad9b592c2","category":"default"}
