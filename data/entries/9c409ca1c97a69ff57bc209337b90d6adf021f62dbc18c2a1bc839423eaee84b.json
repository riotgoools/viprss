The quote was from <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@jeffjarvis/112399386648851185\">Jeff Jarvis</a>, who like me, <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2024/05/06/135847.html#a140303\">cross-posts</a> to a variety of social webs, presumably manually. Where did I put my comment? Hell if I know. Heh I <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@jeffjarvis/112399484570566051\">found</a> it. My comment: \"I didnâ€™t know he had been a blogger. So my respect for him went up dramatically in an instant, and in another instant, plummeted. Whatâ€™s wrong with people?\" Bad news for Ben, he's still is a blogger, btw, in his heart. I can tell. And true journalists and true bloggers share an ethos that the fakers like Morning Joe will never understand. So I guess when you're on with Joe you have to pander. Just remember Ben, we know who you are. Even if you have forgotten. <span>ðŸ˜„</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"9c409ca1c97a69ff57bc209337b90d6adf021f62dbc18c2a1bc839423eaee84b","category":"default"}
