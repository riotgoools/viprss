Till he says, babe, I want to move back to Texas.” Lavin then sings about giving up her career, quitting her improv troupe, taking months off of work, and spending her entire savings on movers, only for him to dump her via a note that said they have nothing in common. </p><p>The video went mega viral and sparked thousands of comments on TikTok, Instagram and X. Immediately people began digging back through her past videos and analyzing every minute detail of their relationship. People <a href=\"https://x.com/ChiefWitxh/status/1847890245783621671\">called Lavin delusional</a> and chastised her for not recognizing signs of his disinterest. </p><p>The entire phenomena felt similar to the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-goods/22716772/west-elm-caleb-couch-guy-tiktok-cancel\">Couch Guy fiasco</a>, where a young man and woman had their lives torn apart after the guy was seeming unexcited to see his girlfriend enter the room in a TikTok video. Obviously the key difference here is that Lavin introduced the topic of her relationship to the masses intentionally. However, as Rebecca Jennings <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-goods/22716772/west-elm-caleb-couch-guy-tiktok-cancel\">wrote in 2022</a>, “The real toxicity within this sort of discourse comes not from viewers but from the web sleuth dynamics that play out afterward.”</p><p>E.J. Dickson at The Cut spoke to Lavin, and you can <a href=\"https://archive.ph/6ItHP#selection-1567.0-1573.12\">read the full interview here</a>. Lavin opens up about her move, the note her ex gave her, why she decided to make a video about it. </p><p>Lavin said that the reaction to her viral moment has played out wildly differently across platforms. “Somebody on Twitter reposted the video, and it got a bunch of views there and the comments were more mean, like ‘This woman’s crazy. It’s her fault for moving,”’” she said. “Whereas on Instagram and places where I posted it directly, it was way more people having compassion.”</p><p>She <a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/article/viral-texas-breakup-story-spritely-tiktok.html\">also said that</a> she would give up all of the viral attention and “probably the most success” she has had in her entire career, to get back together with him.
