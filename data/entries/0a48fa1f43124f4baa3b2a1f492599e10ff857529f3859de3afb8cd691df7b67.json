I had Louise Matsakis on my podcast <em>Power User</em> to break down the state of TikTok and why the U.S. is really banning the app (newsflash: <a href=\"https://matzko.substack.com/p/the-pro-israel-techies-who-got-tiktok\">it’s not about protecting our data from China</a>). </p><p>You can watch the full episode below.

New York Gov. Hochul declared last week that, “This has gone too far,” and asked federal authorities to authorize local police departments to shoot down drones. Trump also he wants the feds to shoot a drone out of the sky. “Let the public know, and now,” <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2024/12/13/us-news/trump-calls-for-drones-to-be-shot-down-as-sightings-plague-new-jersey-maryland-and-new-york/\">Trump said</a>. “Otherwise, shoot them down!”</p><p>The problem is, the vast majority of what the public thinks are drones are just stars, planes, or other small aircraft coming and going from Newark and other small airports. All of this has led to a massive public freak out, with average citizens trying to shoot planes down out of the sky or interrupt their flight paths with lasers. </p><p>Case in point: former Gov. of Maryland Larry Hogan <a href=\"https://x.com/GovLarryHogan/status/1867608947525386534\">posted a long thread on X about how he</a> “personally witnessed (and videoed) what appeared to be dozens of large drones in the sky above his residence.” It turns out what he was looking at was the star constellation Orion and the stars Sirius and Procyon.</p><p>In the meantime, the Pentagon says that the mystery drones are <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/11/pentagon-says-mystery-drones-over-new-jersey-are-not-us-military-not-likely-foreign/\">not military and are not likely foreign</a>.

They’ve been tearing her apart for her body, her face, and basically calling her an ugly hag and a catfish. </p><p>The entire discourse shows just how deluded a lot of men have become about women’s bodies. These men have spent so much time consuming hyper-edited content, porn, and glamorized images of women, that they have forgotten what an actual flesh and blood woman looks like. </p><p>Ironically, a lot of these men were the same ones who held Sydney Sweeney up as an example of the “ideal woman” months ago in the first place and claimed she was a harbinger of the “death of woke.” </p><p>As <a href=\"https://x.com/ComicsComm52/status/1868041507426672924\">one Twitter user posted</a>, “through little/no actual fault of her own, Sydney Sweeney had been embraced by the alt-right as a symbol of traditional femininity. White, blonde, and sexy the way women should be. Now they are turning on her. They hate women and will never truly accept them.”</p><p>The entire “controversy” reminds me of the famous quote from philosopher Marilyn Frye, who wrote in her book, The Politics of Reality: Essays in Feminist Theory, “To say that straight men are heterosexual is only to say that they engage in sex (fucking exclusively with the other sex, i.e., women). All or almost all of that which pertains to love, most straight men reserve exclusively for other men. The people whom they admire, respect, adore, revere, honor, whom they imitate, idolize, and form profound attachments to, whom they are willing to teach and from whom they are willing to learn, and whose respect, admiration, recognition, honor, reverence and love they desire… those are, overwhelmingly, other men. In their relations with women, what passes for respect is kindness, generosity or paternalism; what passes for honor is removal to the pedestal. From women they want devotion, service and sex. Heterosexual male culture is homoerotic; it is man-loving.” </p><p><a href=\"https://www.usermag.co/subscribe?\"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><h2>The Kids Online Safety Act is a dangerous threat to free speech</h2><p>A few years ago, lawyer Greg Lukianoff co-wrote the book the <em>Coddling of the American Mind</em> with NYU Business professor Jonathan Haidt, a man with absolutely zero academic background studying kids and social media, who has recently fashioned himself as an expert on the topic by <a href=\"https://www.wowt.news/p/jonathan-haidt-moral-panic-with-bad-science\">pushing debunked pseudoscience</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNxV4UMRYQA&amp;t=4s\">moral panic around kids and tech</a>.
