A few key findings:</p><ul><li><p>Keywords related to Donald Trump generated nearly 50% more results than those related to Kamala Harris. (almost 3 posts mentioning Trump for every 2 posts mentioning Harris). </p></li><li><p>Sentiment analysis showed that over the past 3 months the majority of social media posts referencing either candidate are negative. </p></li><li><p>Harris has more positive sentiment in the 65+ age group, whereas Trump has more positive sentiment amongst all other age groups.</p></li></ul><p>I think the fundamental difference in strategy between Trump vs Harris this cycle boils down to shortform vs longform. Harris leaned hard into short form content after launching her campaign this summer, successfully dominating TikTok and viral IG type accounts. Meanwhile, Trump sat for hours-long livestreams and built parasocial bonds with young male voters through podcasts. </p><p>I was talking to longtime creator economy expert <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/brendangahan/\">Brendan Gahan</a>, about this issue back in August. Short form creators, while they’re able to gain a massive amount of attention very quickly, struggle to get their audience to form deep, lasting relationships. This leads to a more passive and transient fandom around creators who lean into short form. </p><p>Gahan worried Harris might fall victim to these same dynamics. Aside from a heavily produced episode of <em>Call Her Daddy</em> and a few other sit downs, Harris has avoided doing long form unscripted content. </p><p>Her team’s recent discussions with Rogan reiterate this issue. While it’s understandable that a candidate wouldn’t be able to fly to Austin amidst the final days of a campaign, Harris' wanting the interview to only be an hour shows that her team doesn’t understand the format she’s seeking to engage in. </p><p>Trying to cut a Rogan interview short makes Harris appear scared. Her team may understandably be trying to protect her from a gaffe, but the end result is that she’s missing out on opportunities that Trump is seizing. </p><div><figure><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9834fba3-d24d-4136-9a8c-2af05d2261b6_950x406.png\"><div><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9834fba3-d24d-4136-9a8c-2af05d2261b6_950x406.png\" width=\"510\" height=\"217.9578947368421\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9834fba3-d24d-4136-9a8c-2af05d2261b6_950x406.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9834fba3-d24d-4136-9a8c-2af05d2261b6_950x406.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9834fba3-d24d-4136-9a8c-2af05d2261b6_950x406.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9834fba3-d24d-4136-9a8c-2af05d2261b6_950x406.png 1456w\" loading=\"lazy\" /><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/brendangahan/\">Gahan</a> said, “a lot of people are calling this the TikTok election. I think that's a nice headline, but that's not (generally) where meaningful change takes place. TikTok is a great awareness driver and audience development tool, but to drive action… long form content moves the needle.”</p><p>Long form content allows for deep parasocial bonding, and Trump going on podcasts like <em>Impaulsive</em> or Theo Von’s <em>This Past Weekend</em>, gives fans of those podcasts the opportunity to parasocially bond with him as well.  </p><p>“These parasocial relationships are critical,” said Gahan. “Impressions are not created equal. This bond is what drives meaningful engagement —something short form creators just can't achieve to the same degree.”</p><p>“The left is not doing these type of long form engagements or outreach,” he added. </p><p>All of this made me think of Ashley Carmen’s <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-10-17/why-the-2024-us-presidential-election-is-playing-out-via-top-podcasts\">recent Bloomberg piece</a> on how podcasts have had a breakout election cycle.

The platform had a more direct impact on the 2020 cycle when it was being leveraged as a powerful tool for progressive activism. Now, thanks to aggressive government crackdown in reaction to progressive speech on the app, coupled with the platform’s pivot toward shopping and ecommerce, a lot of that activism has been defanged and the app overall feels neutered. </p><p>The 2024 cycle seems much more shaped by podcasts and X.

Over the summer, Twisters rolled out in 4DX, with shaking seats and water spraying during stormy moments. Now, A24 has announced “<a href=\"https://bloody-disgusting.com/movie/3836719/heretic-advanced-screening-blueberry-pie\">multi-sensory experience</a>” screenings of its new supernatural horror movie Heretic, at Alamo Drafthouse. Moviegoers will be able to smell scents from the new film, including the aroma of blueberry pie. </p><p>Joya Studio, a company that uses cold-air diffusion to disperse the smells throughout the theater, partnered with A24 on the release. Movie goers will also be given scratch-and-sniff cards commemorating the film's release.</p><p>I haven’t seen the movie yet, so I’m not sure how much smell plays a role in the film, but I think this stunt is indicative of a wider shift where going to the movies is less and less about the movie itself and more about the experience. Movie theaters today are becoming more theme park-like, with multi sensory experiences, ticketed seats, and multi-course dining offerings. </p><p>These changes make the experience of going to the movies feel more like an event, but it’s also starting to feel like these theaters are doing <em>too</em> much.
