{"title":"Why is this possible now?","link":"http://scripting.com/2024/10/12/145403.html?title=whyIsThisPossibleNow","date":1728744843000,"content":"<p>BTW, the reason there's such a confluence of power between WordPress and Mastodon is this.</p>\n<p>WordPress has a <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/tree/trunk/packages/wpcom.js\">complete, debugged, deployed, scaled and frozen API</a>. It's been around since 2016 or so.</p>\n<p>In contrast Mastodon, while they're doing excellent work, is trying to wrangle an already large community into a set of consistent interfaces. It's very hard for an outsider like myself to approach, esp when you're overloaded with your own work (which we all are).</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Automattic has a small team whose only job is to make WordPress work with Mastodon.</p>\n<p>So I can build software that works with Mastodon without venturing into the rough seas of Mastodon-land. I can stay on the cruise-liner, which is the WordPress API.</p>\n<p>I didn't even know they had this API until last summer. My jaw dropped when I first saw it. It even works with Node.js. And now that I'm on the other side, I haven't hit any insurmountable obstacles or had to wait for something to be decided.</p>\n<p>This is the proper way to build interop. Implementors make things work, not W3C committees (I say that with decades of experience with this, btw).</p>\n<p>I thought it deserved an explanation.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"4151a7779a386b1b9d2d2bcfc992f69a92a8656e7d6aa382791306d12d771b30","category":"Sites"}
