I used to have an icon in my outliner that tweeted the text of the bar cursor headline. I could make it work once again, but it would be wasted if I couldn't send it to all four of the services I use regularly. Something has changed in the twitterverse, it's grown new centers. But each of them is acting as if they are alone. This is a mistake, for sure for the open web, but I think it may be a strategic mistake for each of them. I could cite lots of examples where this didn't work, when an open ecosystem whose benefits were by then obvious to users, completely erased the ecosystem that had existed before, and with remarkable speed. None of them are strong enough to try to dominate.","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"6413db7faafd892589dfc5e7cd5b78017c9421bda951d747097fee6483de6fb4","category":"Sites"}
