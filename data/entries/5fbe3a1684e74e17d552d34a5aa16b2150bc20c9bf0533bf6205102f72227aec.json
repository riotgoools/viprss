Ecologists put a camera on the bottom of the lock, and viewers around the world can watch a livestream of the camera and, when they see a fish, <a href=\"https://visdeurbel.nl/en/the-fish-doorbell/\">press a doorbell to open the lock allowing the fish the opportunity to continue swimming upstream to their destiny</a>.</p>\n\n<p>This is a YouTube livestream of the doorbell camera, which is what gets shown to viewers on days like today when more than 900 people are watching the camera, but fear not because <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UYEwkHf_p4\">they post a weekly highlight reel</a>.<br />\n</p>\n\n<p>You probably missed the pike and ide, but perch, common roach, and freshwater bream should be swimming by around now.</p>\n\n<p>PS the domain is visdeurbel.nl, which translates into English as Fish Doorbell, and I think Dutch is a very charming language.</p>\n\n<p>(via <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/danirabaiotti.bsky.social/post/3kolspkiwt62h\">@danirabaiotti.bsky.social</a>)</p>\n\n <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/fish\">fish</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/utrecht\">utrecht</a></p>\n\n <p>ðŸ’¬ <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/03/fish-doorbell-in-utrecht\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> â†’</p>\n\n    ","author":"Aaron Cohen","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"5fbe3a1684e74e17d552d34a5aa16b2150bc20c9bf0533bf6205102f72227aec","category":"default"}
