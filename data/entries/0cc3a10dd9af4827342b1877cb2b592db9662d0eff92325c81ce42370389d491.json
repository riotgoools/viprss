Also that writing is not going into any search engine. Normally I watch out for this, but they got me, and you, to write for them for free, and I pay them $20 a month for the privilege. However in balance it is worth it, at least in the short term.","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"0cc3a10dd9af4827342b1877cb2b592db9662d0eff92325c81ce42370389d491","category":"default"}
