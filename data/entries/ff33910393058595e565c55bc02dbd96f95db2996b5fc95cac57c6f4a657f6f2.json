Consider a ranked choice election that has five or six candidates. To win the election, you can’t just appeal to your base. You also can’t alienate your opponent’s base. You want supporters of other candidates to regard you as “not too bad,” because if they hate you, they could rank you very low and get you tossed out of the running quickly.</p>\r\n<p>Candidates are thus encouraged to moderate their positions and their behavior — that is, not to call each other too many names. If the favorite candidate of one voter calls the favorite of another “<a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://boingboing.net/2024/07/30/weird-maga-is-the-meme-of-the-hour.html\" target=\"_blank\">weird</a>,” for example — to choose an example not quite at random — the latter voter might respond by voting down the name-caller to the very bottom.</p>\r\n<p>The result? Negative campaigning diminishes, and politics moderates. The effect can be especially pronounced in party primaries, which sometimes are dominated by the most extreme voters.</p>\r\n<p>The candidates also compete in different ways. In particular, they try to outdo each other when it comes to constituency service, which is a way of being popular without offending anybody.</p>\r\n<p>The broader <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://democracy.issuelab.org/resources/39164/39164.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">evidence</a> on ranked choice voting shows that, when used, it has made US politics more moderate. Alaska’s ranked choice voting <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://alaskapublic.org/2023/09/19/north-to-the-future-alaskas-ranked-choice-voting-system-is-praised-and-criticized-nationally/\" target=\"_blank\">helped</a> moderate Republican Lisa Murkowski beat her more ideological opponents in 2022. In Idaho, some conservatives regard ranked choice voting with <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://idahocapitalsun.com/2023/09/13/former-idaho-gov-butch-otter-endorses-open-primary-ballot-initiative/\" target=\"_blank\">suspicion</a>, fearing it is a plot to neutralize their influence.</p>\r\n<p>In Ireland, politics is fairly non-ideological on most matters of policy, and elections are not typically seen as major, course-altering events. After more than a century with this system, the Irish seem happy to keep it.</p>\r\n<p>The lesson here is that it is not possible to evaluate ranked choice voting in the abstract. It usually makes politics less extreme and less ideological, but those are descriptive terms, not normative ones. I would prefer California’s politics to be less ideological, for example, but that is because it embodies an ideology distinct from mine. And sometimes the more extreme and ideological positions are entirely correct, as for instance John Stuart Mill’s advocacy of women’s suffrage and birth control in the 19th century.</p>\r\n<p>In general, ranked choice voting is best for places where voters feel things are already on the right track and ought to stay there. It is a voting system for the self-satisfied. Which parts of contemporary America might that describe? No voting method yet devised can settle that question.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/08/what-to-think-about-ranked-choice-voting.html\">What to think about ranked choice voting?</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com\">Marginal REVOLUTION</a>.</p>\r\n<img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/902306189/0/marginalrevolution\" />\r\n<div><a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/902306189/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/902306189/marginalrevolution,\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/902306189/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/x.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/902306189/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/902306189/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/08/what-to-think-about-ranked-choice-voting.html#comments\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/comments20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/08/what-to-think-about-ranked-choice-voting.html/feed\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/commentsrss20.png\" /></a> \r\n<div><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/08/what-to-think-about-ranked-choice-voting.html#comments\"><h3>Comments</h3></a><ul><li><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/08/what-to-think-about-ranked-choice-voting.html#comment-160792092\">In reply to Shark Lasers.
