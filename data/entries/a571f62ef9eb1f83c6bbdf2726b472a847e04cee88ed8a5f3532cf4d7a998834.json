{"title":"What Are you Starting Right Now?","link":"https://kottke.org/24/04/what-are-you-starting-right-now","date":1713882114000,"content":"\n        <p>The NY Times Style Magazine <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/04/18/t-magazine/earl-sweatshirt-boots-riley-upcoming-next-projects.html?unlocked_article_code=1.mk0.V4dU._lBSc2RL7fsv\">recently published an entire issue dedicated to “what it means start an artistic life”</a>. I have only scratched the surface of this multi-article package, but I locked into this one immediately: <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/04/18/t-magazine/earl-sweatshirt-boots-riley-upcoming-next-projects.html?unlocked_article_code=1.mk0.V4dU._lBSc2RL7fsv\">We asked 80 artists and other creative people to tell us what they’re starting right now or hope to very soon</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Filmmaker Boots Riley:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>I’m getting ready to start filming a feature I wrote about a group of professional female shoplifters who find a device called a situational accelerator that heightens the conflict of anything they shoot it at. I also have a sci-fi adventure: a janky, lo-fi epic space funk opera. My dream is to use the same crew and shoot the two movies back to back in Oakland, Calif. [where I live]. That’s one thing about being 53 — I want to be able to spend more time with my kids.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Writer Alice McDermott:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>There are three kinds of novels I’ve never taken to heart: science fiction, murder mysteries and novels about novelists. So I’ve decided to try my hand at each. If I fail, they’re probably not books I’d want to read anyway.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Cartoonist Daniel Clowes:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>I’ve always had the desire to do fakes of artworks I admire — to figure out how they were done, and so I could have otherwise unaffordable artwork hanging in my living room. Painting [with oil] is as frustrating and exhilarating as I remember it being when I was in art school 43 years ago, and my paintings look alarmingly not unlike the ones I did at 19.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Artist and writer Nell Irvin Painter:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>I’m way too old to be a beginner. I’m 81 and have already written and published a million (OK, 10) books. But a very different kind of project’s been tugging at me: something like an autobiographical Photoshop document with layers from different phases of my life in the 1960s and ’70s — spent in France, Ghana, the American South. I’d have to be myself at different ages.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Artist Christine Sun Kim:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>I have a bit of an adverse reaction to people doing American Sign Language interpretations of popular songs on social media - they’re usually based entirely on the lyrics in English, when rhyming works differently in ASL. So I’ve been wanting to make a fully native ASL “music” video. One day.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Artist Eric Mack:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>I’m starting to recharge in order to begin my next body of work. I journal, read, explore the Criterion Channel and get deep-tissue massages. I keep wishing I’d organize the fabrics in my studio.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>I love that: Mack shared not what he’s working on next but that he’s using the time to recharge the batteries, a step that’s often neglected, either out of sheer economic necessity, obsession, or fear (I was *terrified* to take time off from the site for years). And I want to see both of those films by Boots Riley — “a situational accelerator”?!</p>\n\n<p>So. What are you starting right now or hope to very soon?</p>\n\n <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/art\">art</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/creative%20processes\">creative processes</a></p>\n\n <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/04/what-are-you-starting-right-now\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"a571f62ef9eb1f83c6bbdf2726b472a847e04cee88ed8a5f3532cf4d7a998834","category":"default"}
