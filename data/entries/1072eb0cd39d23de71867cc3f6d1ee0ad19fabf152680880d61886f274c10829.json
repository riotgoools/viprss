It’s the second half of this short video. Amazing. The first part shows the rover speeding off (at about 6 miles/hr), being put through its paces. From <a href=\"http://next.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.trvlm1.html\">the transcript of the “Grand Prix”</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>124:58:52 Duke: The suspension system on that thing is fantastic!</p>\n\n<p>124:58:54 England: That sounds good. We sound like we probably got enough of the Grand Prix. We’re willing to let you go on from here. Call that a (complete) Grand Prix.</p>\n\n<p>124:59:03 Duke: Okay. (Pause) Man, that was all four wheels off the ground, there. Okay. Max stop.</p>\n\n<p>124:59:12 Young: Okay. I don’t want to do that.</p>\n\n<p>124:59:13 Duke: Okay. Excuse me.</p>\n\n<p>124:59:16 Young: They say that’s a no-no.</p>\n\n<p>124:59:22 Duke: Okay, DAC off; Mark. Okay, John. DAC’s off.</p>\n\n<p>124:59:27 Young: Okay. I have a lot of confidence in the stability of this contraption.</p>\n\n<p>124:59:30 Duke: Me, too.</p>\n\n<p>124:59:32 England: Sounds great.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Also, we took a fucking car to the Moon! Three times!</p>\n\n         <p><em>[This is a vintage post originally from Jan 2013.]</em></p>\n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Apollo\">Apollo</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Apollo%2016\">Apollo 16</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/NASA\">NASA</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/space\">space</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/timeless%20posts\">timeless posts</a></p>\n\n        \n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"1072eb0cd39d23de71867cc3f6d1ee0ad19fabf152680880d61886f274c10829","category":"Sites"}
