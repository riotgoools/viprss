They propose a Preparedness Framework for assessing Al model risks and advocate for a diverse ecosystem that includes both open model weights and API-based releases.

Here’s why the situation is complex regarding</p>\n<p>“openness” with OpenAl and its models:</p>\n<p>It’s Not Fully Open-Source</p>\n<p>Code and Weights Not Public: The core code behind OpenAl’s models like GPT-3 or GPT-4, and the specific “weights” (data the model was trained on) are not released to the public. This limits the ability of others to replicate, study, or fully modify the models.<br />\nAPI Access: Instead, OpenAl primarily offers access through their API, which involves paying for usage. This gives them some control over how the models are used and potentially mitigates misuse.</p>\n<p>Reasons for Limited “Openness”</p>\n<p>Misuse Potential: Large language models are powerful and can be misused for generating harmful text, propaganda, or spreading misinformation. OpenAl likely wants to control the spread to manage these risks.<br />\nCommercial Interests: OpenAl is a company, and making the models readily available could undermine their business model of selling APl access.<br />\nComputational Cost: These models are extremely expensive to train and run. Providing full access might lead to unsustainable resource usage.</p>\n<p>The Debate</p>\n<p>There’s ongoing debate about whether Al models this powerful should be open-source:</p>\n<p>Pro-Openness: Advocates argue it promotes transparency, community-driven improvements, and fights potential biases within the models.<br />\nPro-Controlled Release: Others argue responsible release, especially with potentially dangerous technology, is crucial.OpenAl likely falls into this camp.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>","author":"MDG","siteTitle":"Mark Ghuneim","siteHash":"fbdbfb355dab5247b3a3d9c04401313e99252873a1ae0fb1ea729c2e5736c6f3","entryHash":"e52261493916d799599e51ccc50e31e5e60ad5c0009e8ca540f8b153f5379a1d","category":"default"}
