He created 30 drawings a day for an entire year and then animated them: “Set at 30 frames a second, each second represents 1 day.” The animation is accompanied by audio Jannace recorded on his phone during the year. </p>\n\n<p>If you watch the whole thing, you get to experience what a year feels like if days were shrunk down into seconds.
