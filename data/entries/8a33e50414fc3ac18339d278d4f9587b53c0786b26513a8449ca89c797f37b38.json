Kevin Kelly and I are running another Walk and Talk with a classic ragtag crew of walkers. This is our … sixth or seventh or eighth (depending on how you count (we did a couple pre-Walk and Talks before transitioning into the Full Walk and Talk model)). We’ve walked Spain, China, Thailand, Indonesia, England, and Japan. And we’re back to England once again, mainly because the walking is so uncomplicated, rights of way galore, with infrastructure in place to make the talking effortless.","author":"","siteTitle":"Craig Mod","siteHash":"7358923c3192bccfb6b9f0032f475bef5140f12de0f235c80ca3d98e1a3d393b","entryHash":"8a33e50414fc3ac18339d278d4f9587b53c0786b26513a8449ca89c797f37b38","category":"Sites"}
