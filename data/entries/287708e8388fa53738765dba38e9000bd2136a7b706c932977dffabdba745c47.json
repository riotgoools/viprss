I am your host, the <em>most fantabulous</em> Paul Anthony\nWebb a/k/a NetOperator Wibby (virtually everywhere else on the vast Internet).\nWhat can you expect from theWebb.blog? Basically anything that comes out of my\nhead and holds my attention long enough to be written about.</p>\n<p>I thought about porting the posts from my previous blog<a href=\"https://dsgn.io/thoughts\">2</a>, but I'd rather\nstart fresh. After all, after the <em>tumultuous</em> year that was 2016, I think we\ncould <em>all</em> use a fresh start.</p>\n<p>As a professional front-end web designer and developer, I thought about\ncreating a beautiful theme to showcase my dope skills but I tend to go\noverboard and never release things. I'm aiming to change that. I was also going\nto write my own blogging platform after my frustration and false start with\nGhost<a href=\"https://ghost.org\">3</a> but then I found Hexo<a href=\"https://hexo.io\">4</a> (shoutout to the creator of NX framework<a href=\"https://github.com/solkimicreb\">5</a>\nfor the recommendation)!</p>\n<p>Long story short, I intend to stick around with this blog for quote some time.\nFancy upgrades and whatnot will happen over the next year and years after that.\nKottke<a href=\"http://kottke.org\">6</a> has been blogging since 2008. I graduated high school in 2006!\n<em>Crazy</em>.</p>\n<p>I hope you'll find my little area on the Internet of interest at least a few\ntimes. ðŸ•¸</p>\n<hr />\n","author":"","siteTitle":"the webb blog","siteHash":"d87386c8de21b16d23a4d22ceb0991728c5b4e4486d627490c6fcde14e563300","entryHash":"287708e8388fa53738765dba38e9000bd2136a7b706c932977dffabdba745c47","category":"Sites"}
