I don't trust the car not to kill me though. I spend most of my working life dealing with bugs in software. It's very easy for me to imagine what could go wrong. I don't understand how people can trust a computer with their lives this way. It's also disconcerting that the car coming at me in the other direction could be computer-driven. And nowadays when I see the other car is a Tesla, esp this month when everyone's getting a free demo of FSD, it's somewhat likely the OP is a computer.","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"b4afa594fd7c2af2762e19923e8d369ca5091d36e5d3b2c4991e2adffe90630d","category":"default"}
