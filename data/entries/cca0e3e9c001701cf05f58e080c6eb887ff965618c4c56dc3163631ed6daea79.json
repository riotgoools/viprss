I was surprised to see it begins with the story of podcasting, which has my name in it, which was gratifying. A lot of people will read that. I'm including a <a href=\"https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/10/28/stratechery.png\">screen shot</a> of the beginning because his newsletter is not something you can read without a subscription (which I was graciously given complementary). As with John Naughton, we disagree when podcasting got its name, I say it was in Sept 2004, they repeat the mistake on the Wikipedia site that says it was coined earlier by a columnist for the Guardian. I'd like to get this right someday. Podcasting was a four year slog with lots of trial and error, lots of it, and passionate belief by a few people, and hard work. This is the power of journalism, not only can they ignore our work, but when it's successful they can give themselves credit for the idea, obviating all the creativity and work that made it happen, almost as if that was incidental. We'll win this one eventually. There's plenty of evidence to back it up. We took reasonably good notes. (BTW, the enclosure element was part of <a href=\"https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html#hrelementsOfLtitemgt\">RSS 2.0</a> in 2002, not 2003, as it says in the Stratechery mention.)","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"cca0e3e9c001701cf05f58e080c6eb887ff965618c4c56dc3163631ed6daea79","category":"Sites"}
