I was surprised to see it begins with the story of podcasting, which has my name in it, which was gratifying. A lot of people will read that. I'm including a <a href=\"https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/10/28/stratechery.png\">screen shot</a> of the beginning because his newsletter is not something you can read without a subscription.","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"cca0e3e9c001701cf05f58e080c6eb887ff965618c4c56dc3163631ed6daea79","category":"Sites"}
