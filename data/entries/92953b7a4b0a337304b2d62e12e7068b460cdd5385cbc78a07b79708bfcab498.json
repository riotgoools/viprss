Intended for pilots, the FAA publishes free detailed maps of the entire U.S. airspace, and detailed maps of airports and their surroundings and updates them frequently. The density of the critical information layered on these maps is staggering, and it is a miracle that pilots can easily decipher these mapsâ€™ at a glance.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Oh wow, this takes me back. My dad was a <a href=\"https://kottke.org/15/06/flying-with-my-dad\">pilot</a> when I was a kid and he had a bunch of FAA maps in the house, in his planes, and even on the walls of his office. I remember finding these maps both oddly beautiful and almost completely inscrutable. What a treat to be able to finally figure out how to read them, at least a little bit. And the waypoint names are fun too:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>Orlando, FL has many Disney themed waypoints such as JAFAR, PIGLT, JAZMN, TTIGR, MINEE, HKUNA and MTATA. Flying into Orlando, your plane might use the SNFLD arrival path, taking you past NOOMN, FORYU, SNFLD, JRRYY and GTOUT.</p>\n\n<p>Based on the waypoints near Atlantaâ€™s Hartsfield-Jackson International, this airport must be home to some of the nerdiest air traffic controllers. Thereâ€™s a crazy number of Lord of the Rings waypoints: HOBTT, SHYRE, FRDDO, BLLBO, BGGNS, NZGUL, RAETH, ORRKK, GOLLM, ROHUN, GONDR, GIMLY, STRDR, SMAWG and GNDLF.</p></blockquote>\n\n        \n\n <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/design\">design</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/flying\">flying</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/infoviz\">infoviz</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Jon%20Keegan\">Jon Keegan</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/maps\">maps</a></p>\n\n <p>ðŸ’¬ <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/02/faa-aviation-maps\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> â†’</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"92953b7a4b0a337304b2d62e12e7068b460cdd5385cbc78a07b79708bfcab498","category":"default"}
