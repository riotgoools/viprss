{"title":"One Strange Side Effect of Parenting","link":"https://kottke.org/24/05/strange-side-effect-of-parenting","date":1715889627000,"content":"\n        <p>The other day while singing to my daughter, I realized that I can, in fact, sing better than I used to. I think the sheer amount of “Wheels on the Bus” and “Row, Row, Row Your Boat” did the trick: I enjoy it more now and feel like I’m hitting more of the right notes. I’m still not “good,” but I’m not bad, and I’m less embarrassed to be caught singing in front of other people. It reminds me of the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/25/magazine/terry-gross-and-the-art-of-opening-up.html\">Terry Gross detail</a> that she took voice lessons not to become a better singer but simply so she could sing along more pleasurably to music she loved. </p>\n\n<p>Has anyone else been singing anything fun lately? For their kids, or in any other situation? I’ve been singing a lot of Carrie Anne, by The Hollies.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/parenting\">parenting</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/singing\">singing</a></p>\n\n         <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/05/strange-side-effect-of-parenting\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Edith Zimmerman","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"10310da2f224999af5c59875e0a5ce8d4d4d34a0fc421b87128a9dc730357a50","category":"default"}
