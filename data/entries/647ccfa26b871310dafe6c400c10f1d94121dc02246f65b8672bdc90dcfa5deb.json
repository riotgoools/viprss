And yet against this natural grandeur, we suffer the smallness of our imagination about death, as about the myriad small deaths punctuating life — the losses, the endings, the falterings of hope — forgetting somehow that every ending is a beginning in retrograde, that what may seem like a terminus may be a transformation.</p>\n<figure><a href=\"https://society6.com/a/products/another-horizon-great-white-heron_print?curator=brainpicker\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GreatWhiteHeron_by_MariaPopova.jpg?resize=680%2C858&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"680\" height=\"858\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GreatWhiteHeron_by_MariaPopova.jpg?w=1015&amp;ssl=1 1015w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GreatWhiteHeron_by_MariaPopova.jpg?resize=320%2C404&amp;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GreatWhiteHeron_by_MariaPopova.jpg?resize=600%2C757&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GreatWhiteHeron_by_MariaPopova.jpg?resize=240%2C303&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GreatWhiteHeron_by_MariaPopova.jpg?resize=768%2C969&amp;ssl=1 768w\" /></a><figcaption>Great white heron, Holbox Island.
