They need to be able to follow us back. They need to see when we mention them. Those are such basic things.\" They got what they wanted, they got the users and press to relax because they’re Facebook who we know, but this is different, it’s the fediverse. And they got Eugen and others to validate them. This always works, standard tech playbook. they give up nothing, then the priority changes. I don't like being right. But they're never going to change in Silicon Valley. They do what works, and take advantage of newcomers who want to believe.","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"f51c7ba0f6cc66f3a1dfbf2ec132679c8c581b15d2d6241e7be16438f321d9e9","category":"Sites"}
