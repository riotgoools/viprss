{"title":"Princess Catherine on Instagram","link":"https://kottke.org/24/03/princess-catherine-on-instagram","date":1710179596000,"content":"\n        <p>“Like many amateur photographers, I do occasionally experiment with editing.” Well, I can’t resist the kerfuffle around what’s going on with Princess Catherine. Yesterday she posted <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/C4U_IqTNaqU\">a photo</a> of herself with her family that turned out to have been edited, and today <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/11/world/europe/princess-kate-middleton-photo-edit-apology.html?unlocked_article_code=1.b00.BToE.6yBOdxlLA-D0&amp;smid=url-share\">she apologized</a> for “any confusion” it might have caused. (Shared presumably in part to dispel rumors about her health and whereabouts, the photo “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/10/world/europe/princess-catherine-photo.html\">fans [those rumors] instead</a>,” per the NY Times.)</p>\n\n<p>Last week, Nieman Lab ran a <a href=\"https://www.niemanlab.org/2024/03/this-is-just-weird-buzzfeed-news-former-royals-reporter-on-kate-middleton-palace-press-and-distrust-in-the-media/\">story</a> on how unusual the Palace’s response to gossip surrounding the situation has been. And if you really want to get into the weeds, Nieman Lab’s editor-in-chief Laura Hazard Owen also <a href=\"https://twitter.com/laurahazardowen/status/1767181233656676722\">just linked</a> to a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/laurahazardowen/status/1767181233656676722\">three-minute TikTok video</a> proposing that the original Instagram photo was actually taken last November.</p>\n\n<p>See also Hilary Mantel’s <a href=\"https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v35/n04/hilary-mantel/royal-bodies\">2013 essay</a> in the London Review of Books: “I wanted to apologise. I wanted to say: it’s nothing personal, it’s monarchy I’m staring at.”</p>\n\n <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Catherine%20Princess%20of%20Wales\">Catherine Princess of Wales</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Hilary%20Mantel\">Hilary Mantel</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Instagram\">Instagram</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Laura%20Hazard%20Owen\">Laura Hazard Owen</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/photography\">photography</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/royals\">royals</a></p>\n\n <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/03/princess-catherine-on-instagram\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Edith Zimmerman","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"e6291fa027b37976c9c63af9a74bc8421166b4fe25a7483a5458ff592c90cc5d","category":"default"}
