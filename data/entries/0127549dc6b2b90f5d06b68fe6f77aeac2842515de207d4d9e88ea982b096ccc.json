Several of her songs deal with sex. \"Juno\" has lyrics like, “I like the way you fit. God bless your dad’s genetics” and “explore me, I’m so fucking horny.”</p><p>All of this is completely fine, again, because Carpenter is a full grown adult. But the thread went viral and sparked an entire outrage cycle of discourse about whether it’s appropriate for a female pop star to talk about sex. The “Im 17 and AFRAID” language quickly became a meme and people began to <a href=\"https://x.com/iggyp00p/status/1846032653104906278\">post it as copypasta all over Twitter.</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.themarysue.com/im-17-and-afraid-of-sabrina-carpenter-one-fans-response-to-the-short-n-sweet-tour-gave-us-a-new-meme/\">News outlets wrote up</a> the viral meme, aggregating tweets and boosting the original poster even more. But there is a very crucial detail that was ignored: The “I’m 17 and I’m AFRAID of Sabrina carpenter” account is not some neutral observer of pop culture;<strong> </strong>they are an anti-Sabrina, anti-Selena Gomez, pro-Taylor and pro-Ariana stan account who is successfully trolling for engagement, smearing Sabrina in order to drive more eyeballs and attention to threads that promote their favored artists.</p><p>On the same thread where they bash Carpenter, they boost Taylor Swift, saying “You never see Taylor showing herself on stage like that. Queen Tay Tay remains Sabrina's ender.” This is not even the first time that this pop account has trolled for engagement. They’ve picked fights with Nicki Minaj’s stans – the barbs – by encouraging followers to reply to a post about Ariana Grande with \"Nicki Tanked.\"</p><p>While this sort of posting strategy might seem trivial, the same engagement farming and stan-baiting tactics that pop culture accounts use are now being replicated across the rest of the news and politics ecosystem online. Big political accounts troll for engagement and feed into fandoms. X has become overrun with large accounts attempting to mainstream memes for their own benefit, and often profit. Developing a nuanced understanding of stan Twitter is a crucial form of media literacy. </p><div><div></div></div><p>Stan accounts are masters of engagement farming, using emotionally charged, often misleading content to spark viral outrage or intense support. They manipulate algorithms by flooding timelines with memes, copypasta, and viral phrases that seem organic but are carefully crafted to drive specific narratives. </p><p>This strategy of boosting or derailing discourse can be benign in pop culture, but it paves the way for similar manipulation regarding real, important issues. These techniques are no longer limited to entertainment, they’re being deployed in ways that shape public opinion on critical social and political matters.</p><p>The far right has excelled at this. For instance, look at accounts like the right-wing troll page “Richard Strocher” (yes, that’s Dick Stroker). I <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf1jI-zoETE&amp;t=9s\">made a video about this months ago</a>, but the white nationalist account is constantly posting engagement bait around news events and issues to amass attention and boost their posts in the algorithm. When tunnels were discovered under the synagogue in Brooklyn, he <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf1jI-zoETE&amp;t=9s\">pretended to live above them</a>. Thousands of users fell for the bait and boosted his following.</p><p><a href=\"https://x.com/NickAdamsinUSA\">Nick Adams</a>, a self-professed “alpha male” is another right-wing account that has amassed over 575,700 followers using stan Twitter tactics. His series of Fortnite posts, for instance, are aimed at baiting average people who enjoy these things to respond, set off discourse, and ultimately push his toxic, pro-Trump narratives around masculinity. </p><div><figure><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/NickAdamsinUSA/status/1602193077669695489\"><div><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F226617ef-bfb8-4a41-8bbd-db4a04aefb75_746x438.png\" width=\"446\" height=\"261.8605898123324\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F226617ef-bfb8-4a41-8bbd-db4a04aefb75_746x438.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F226617ef-bfb8-4a41-8bbd-db4a04aefb75_746x438.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F226617ef-bfb8-4a41-8bbd-db4a04aefb75_746x438.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F226617ef-bfb8-4a41-8bbd-db4a04aefb75_746x438.png 1456w\" loading=\"lazy\" /><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>X’s monetization schemes for blue check accounts only exacerbate these dynamics. Blue check accounts can now receive monetary payouts based on the level of engagement they drive on their posts. “Stans pioneered this before there was even a monetization element,” said journalist Kat Tenbarge, “but fan-bait has definitely boomed with monetization and the For You Page algorithm.” </p><p>If people can't recognize these basic stan tactics when they appear in pop culture contexts, such as a Twitter thread claiming \"I'm 17 and AFRAID of Sabrina Carpenter,\" how will they ever recognize the same strategies when political actors use them to influence elections, policy debates, or global narratives? </p><p>The ability to manipulate public discourse and quietly push certain agendas online is powerful. It can directly impact real-world decisions and democratic processes. We need people to recognize these sorts of campaigns for what they are in order to navigate not just fan wars but a rapidly evolving digital landscape where the lines between entertainment and politics continue to blur.</p><div><div><div><p>User Mag is a reader-supported publication.
