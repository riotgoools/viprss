{"title":"Wallace & Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl","link":"https://kottke.org/24/06/wallace-gromit-vengeance-most-fowl","date":1718393137000,"content":"\n        <p></p>\n\n<p>Wallace &amp; Gromit are returning for a feature-length film later this year — and so is Feathers McGraw, the scofflaw penguin that made off with the wrong trousers in, um, <a href=\"https://kottke.org/16/09/the-best-movie-chase-scene-ever\">The Wrong Trousers</a>. Here’s the premise of <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/wallace-and-gromit-vengeance-most-fowl-release-date-plot-news\">Vengeance Most Fowl</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>In this next installment, Gromit’s concern that Wallace is becoming too dependent on his inventions proves justified, when Wallace invents a “smart” gnome that seems to develop a mind of its own. When it emerges that a vengeful figure from the past might be masterminding things, it falls to Gromit to battle sinister forces and save his master … or Wallace may never be able to invent again!</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Timely! Vengeance Most Fowl will debut on BBC in the UK in late December and at some later date <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/title/81351936\">on Netflix</a> in the US and elsewhere.</p>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Aardman%20Animations\">Aardman Animations</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/movies\">movies</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/trailers\">trailers</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/video\">video</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Wallace%20and%20Gromit\">Wallace and Gromit</a></p>\n\n         <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/06/wallace-gromit-vengeance-most-fowl\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"e97b28fe31703023d89f41030503a09eb42708cfb90df6fa22851403ad8282fb","category":"default"}
