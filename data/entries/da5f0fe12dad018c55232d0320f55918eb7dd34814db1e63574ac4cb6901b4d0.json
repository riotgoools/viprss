Hokusai created the woodblock print in 1831 at the age of 71 as part of his series <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirty-six_Views_of_Mount_Fuji\">Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji</a>. But in some sense, he‚Äôd been working on it all of his life.</p>\n\n<p>In 1797, at the age of 37, Hokusai made what could be interpreted as his first wave print, <a href=\"https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/A_1937-0710-0-206\">Spring at Enoshima</a> (Enoshima shunb√¥):</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/hokusai-wave-01.jpg\" srcset=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=500,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/hokusai-wave-01.jpg 500w, /cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/hokusai-wave-01.jpg 1200w\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1300\" height=\"855\" alt=\"a woodblock print of a wave by Hokusai\" /></p>\n\n<p>Hokusai made his next attempt in 1803 (age 43) with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Kanagawa-oki_Honmoku_no_zu.jpg\">View of Honmoku off Kanagawa</a> (Kanagawa-oki Honmoku no zu):</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/hokusai-wave-02.jpg\" srcset=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=500,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/hokusai-wave-02.jpg 500w, /cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/hokusai-wave-02.jpg 1200w\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1300\" height=\"827\" alt=\"a woodblock print of a wave by Hokusai\" /></p>\n\n<p>Two years later in 1805 (age 45) came <a href=\"https://collections.mfa.org/objects/234341\">Express Delivery Boats Rowing through Waves</a> (Oshiokuri hat√¥ ts√ªsen no zu) and it‚Äôs starting to look familiar:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/hokusai-wave-03.jpg\" srcset=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=500,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/hokusai-wave-03.jpg 500w, /cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/hokusai-wave-03.jpg 1200w\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1300\" height=\"952\" alt=\"a woodblock print of a wave by Hokusai\" /></p>\n\n<p>A few waves show up in Hokusai‚Äôs three-volume <a href=\"https://kottke.org/23/01/lessons-on-how-to-draw-by-hokusai\">Quick Lessons in Simplified Drawing</a> (1812).</p>\n\n<p>In 1831 at the age of 71, Hokusai returned to waves with The Great Wave off Kanagawa (Kanagawa-oki Nami Ura):</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/hokusai-wave-04.jpg\" srcset=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=500,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/hokusai-wave-04.jpg 500w, /cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/hokusai-wave-04.jpg 1200w\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1300\" height=\"874\" alt=\"a woodblock print of a wave by Hokusai\" /></p>\n\n<p>As others have noted, this version is fantastically impressionistic ‚Äî it evokes a feeling just as much as it depicts a scene. The others are nice works of art, but this is the work of a master at the peak of his expressive powers.<sup><a href=\"#fn:1716234095\">1</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>But that wasn‚Äôt the end of the story. Here‚Äôs <a href=\"https://www.roningallery.com/fuji-at-sea-kaijo-no-fuji\">Fuji at Sea</a> (Kaijo no Fuji) from circa 1834, made at age 74 ‚Äî it looks great <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:A_colored_version_of_the_Big_wave_from_100_views_of_the_Fuji,_2nd_volume.jpg\">in color</a>:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/hokusai-wave-05.jpg\" srcset=\"/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=500,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/hokusai-wave-05.jpg 500w, /cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/hokusai-wave-05.jpg 1200w\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1300\" height=\"957\" alt=\"a woodblock print of a wave by Hokusai\" /></p>\n\n<p>Right around the same period, Hokusai made <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kajikazawa_in_Kai_Province\">Kajikazawa in Kai Province</a> (K≈çsh≈´ Kajikazawa) and <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/100627/fishing-boats-at-choshi-in-shimosa-soshu-choshi-from-the-series-one-thousand-pictures-of-the-ocean-chie-no-umi\">Fishing Boats at Choshi in Shimosa</a> (Soshu Choshi). Later on, Hokusai allegedly made a pair of paintings referred to as <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Femenine_wave.jpg\">Feminine Wave</a> and <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Masculine_wave.jpg\">Masculine Wave</a>, but I can‚Äôt find any information about them online outside of sites selling prints. [Edit: the Feminine &amp; Masculine Waves are featured in <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0500094063/ref=nosim/0sil8\">Hokusai: Beyond the Great Wave</a>, based on an exhibition in the British Museum. (thx, jody)]</p>\n\n<p>What did Hokusai make of this progression over his career? In a colophon to his series <a href=\"https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/78803\">One Hundred Views of Mount Fuji</a> (Fugaku hyakkei), he <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Hundred_Views_of_Mount_Fuji\">wrote</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>From the age of six I had a penchant for copying the form of things, and from about fifty, my pictures were frequently published; but until the age of seventy, nothing that I drew was worthy of notice. At seventy-three years, I was somewhat able to fathom the growth of plants and trees, and the structure of birds, animals, insects, and fish. Thus, when I reach eighty years, I hope to have made increasing progress, and at ninety to see further into the underlying principles of things, so that at one hundred years I will have achieved a divine state in my art, and at one hundred and ten, every dot and every stroke will be as though alive. Those of you who live long enough, bear witness that these words of mine prove not false.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Note: Screenshots of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tkasasagi/status/1045032454371696640\">a viral tweet from 2018</a> about this series of prints <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/C6z7Zlhuw4L/\">are going</a> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/C7CKablOWgg/\">around again</a>. I‚Äôm sure it will shock you to learn that some of the math and dates haven‚Äôt been fact-checked as well as they could have been. I‚Äôve documented the names of the artworks shown here and relied on primary sources for their dates where possible. I‚Äôve used 1760 as the year of Hokusai‚Äôs birth and the dates of works are when they were made, not when they were first published. Please let me know if I‚Äôve made any errors‚Ä¶I‚Äôd love for this post to be as correct as possible.</p>\n\n<ol><p><li>See also an old post (in the old design!) about <a href=\"https://kottke.org/08/08/old-masters-and-young-geniuses\">Old Masters and Young Geniuses</a>.<a href=\"#fnref:1716234095\">‚Ü©</a></li></p></ol>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/art\">art</a> ¬∑ <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Katsushika%20Hokusai\">Katsushika Hokusai</a></p>\n\n         <p>üí¨ <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/05/the-evolution-of-hokusais-great-wave\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> ‚Üí</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"da5f0fe12dad018c55232d0320f55918eb7dd34814db1e63574ac4cb6901b4d0","category":"default"}
