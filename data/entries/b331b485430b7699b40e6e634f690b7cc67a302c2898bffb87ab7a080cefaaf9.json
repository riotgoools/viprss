Some people will be surprised I think to find that they're in this archive. If this works it'll be like the index in the back of a huge and very detailed and repetitive memoir, but it will read in the aggregate. That's the beauty and unique feature of this new medium. I know I've tried this before, but this time I think I'll be able to do it myself and fuss over it and learn from it the way I do software development. Converting a very large work of writing into a reference.","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"b331b485430b7699b40e6e634f690b7cc67a302c2898bffb87ab7a080cefaaf9","category":"default"}
