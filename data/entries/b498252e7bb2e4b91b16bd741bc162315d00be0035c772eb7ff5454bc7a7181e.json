I love Gallery because of the focus on displaying, discovering, and posting art, which is an underserved area in blockchain related media as most of the tools are focused on trading. Gallery is sort the social art sharing platform I've wished for since I got into the space (hopefully, one day, I'll also be able to display my Goool work from Fantom on there too!)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://mirror.xyz/riotgoools.eth/2jqkL1Uh-z-eqwZmrEty19y0UTcd2EIMmS0QclTReyE\">Read the full entry</a></p>\n","author":"elle","siteTitle":"elle","siteHash":"7e5129fe3f5513780be522d901263accb61be79b3a0e9bbe44e73d0e66dada6d","entryHash":"b498252e7bb2e4b91b16bd741bc162315d00be0035c772eb7ff5454bc7a7181e","category":"default"}
