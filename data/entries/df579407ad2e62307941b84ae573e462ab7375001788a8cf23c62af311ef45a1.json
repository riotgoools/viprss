You could register as an independent blogger, and push your writing up to their cloud in real time. And then readers could ask what experts on <i>whatever</i> think about <i>what just happened</i> and it would know what your expertise is, and it could build the report also in realtime, in response to a very detailed question you could ask. And you could tell it whether or not you want lies, or if they should omit the lies. Personally I would opt out of the lies, but some people like lies in their news, kind of like menthol in cigarettes. And forget about paying the news orgs. They don't give you a way to opt out of the lies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"df579407ad2e62307941b84ae573e462ab7375001788a8cf23c62af311ef45a1","category":"Sites"}
