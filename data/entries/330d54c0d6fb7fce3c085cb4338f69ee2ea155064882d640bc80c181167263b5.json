The piece is about, in <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/polgreen.bsky.social/post/3kzlry7mgme2f\">Polgreen’s words</a>, “the sneaky effort to use what looks like science to justify broad intrusions in our personal freedom”.</p>\n\n<p>I usually don’t do this, but I’ve excerpted the article’s conclusion here because it just gets right to the heart of an urgent concern: the freedom to control our own bodies.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>Imagine that your health care required objective justification, if access to birth control or erectile dysfunction medications required proving that you were having monogamous sex, or good sex, or sex at all. Or if fertility care was provided only if you could prove that becoming a parent would make you happy, or you would be a good parent. Or that abortion would be available only if you could prove that it would improve your life.</p>\n\n<p>In a free society we agree that these are private matters, decided by individuals and their families, with the support of doctors using mainstream medical science as a guide, even when they involve children. We invite politicians and judges into them at great peril to our freedom.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>I encourage you to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/13/opinion/cass-report-trans-kids.html?unlocked_article_code=1.Ck4.t6ZV.zESy0Rbxu3G7\">read the whole thing</a> — it’s interesting throughout.</p>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/gender\">gender</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/LGBTQ\">LGBTQ</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Lydia%20Polgreen\">Lydia Polgreen</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/medicine\">medicine</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/politics\">politics</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/science\">science</a></p>\n\n         <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/08/science-and-our-personal-bodily-freedoms\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"330d54c0d6fb7fce3c085cb4338f69ee2ea155064882d640bc80c181167263b5","category":"default"}
