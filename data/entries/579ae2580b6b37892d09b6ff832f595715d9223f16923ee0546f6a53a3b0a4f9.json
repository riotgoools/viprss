It should have been updated and run every time Trump ups the ante.  </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.threads.net/@kamalahq/post/DBjMQCDsZdy\">An example</a>. Trump says Americans who criticize the Supreme Court for overturning Roe v. Wade should be imprisoned:  ‚ÄúThese people should be put in jail for the way they talk about our judges and justices.‚Äù </p>\n<p>A news story on this subject should include calls to all the <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/justices.aspx\">justices</a> on the Supreme Court to ask if they agree or disagree. It's time to bust some new norms. They are above reproach, traditionally, but they decided that the president can do whatever he wants, break any law without penalty. Are they concerned that perhaps they might be imprisoned if they make a decision that Trump doesn't like? Let's learn from them, how they think American citizens should feel about this. After all they are American citizens too, aren't they? If we can be jailed, or worse, for our speech, why not them? <span>üòÑ</span></p>\n<p>Of course if they refuse to answer, which they probably will, that should be part of the story. No deference allowed, by the journalists. Simple factual statements. </p>\n<p>We've relied too much on the Democrats to stick their necks out, when in fact all our necks are on the line here. So if you have something to say about this, now is the time to do it. In a couple of weeks it might be too late. </p>","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"579ae2580b6b37892d09b6ff832f595715d9223f16923ee0546f6a53a3b0a4f9","category":"Sites"}
