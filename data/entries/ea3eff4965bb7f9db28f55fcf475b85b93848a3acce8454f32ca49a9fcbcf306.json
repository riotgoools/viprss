Special shoutout goes to Maurice Cherry<a href=\"https://twitter.com/mauricecherry\">1</a> for being the\nplug for this! If you don't know much about me and how I got started in the\ntech space, it's a great read<a href=\"https://mailchimp.com/resources/resources-for-partners/a-lesson-in-bouncing-back-from-web-designer-paul-anthony-webb\">2</a>.</p>\n<p>Here are some excerpts from the interview, my tips on how to keep going:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><em>Find someone who will collaborate with you.</em> \"<em>Collaboration means you get\nsomeone else's experience,</em>\" Webb says. \"<em>It can also help you keep a\nrealistic mindset of what's possible.</em>\" A lack of knowledge combined with\nunrealistic expectations can be a toxic combination during any project.\nCollaborating with a partner can help you avoid those pitfalls.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><em>Find value in seeing results.</em> \"<em>One thing that motivates me is that I just\nwant to see things happen,</em>\" Webb says. \"<em>If I have an idea and don't see\nanybody else doing it, then I'm going to do it just to see the result.</em>\" Even\nif your project isn't going the way you hoped, there's still a lot that can\nbe learned from seeing it through to the end.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><em>Find a way to simplify.</em> \"<em>Stuff takes on a life of its own sometimes,</em>\"\nWebb says. \"<em>There's usually a way to make it simpler. When a project gets\ntoo frustrating, I start to look for what I can strip away.</em>\" When you feel\noverwhelmed, take a break and come back with a fresh eye toward how you can\nmake things simpler. It may help breathe new life into your project.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Oh yeah, check out these dope illustrations of me by Marco Boulais<a href=\"http://www.marcoboulais.com\">3</a>.
