It's got a really nice taste. Went to the store today, they only had one 12-pack, but they also had a 12-pack of <a href=\"https://www.coca-cola.com/us/en/brands/coca-cola/products/coca-cola-spiced\">Coke Spiced Zero</a>. I decided to give it a try. I had a can at lunch and it's weird but okay I guess, but the belches are strongly flavored and that's <i>realllly</i> weird. It took me a while to figure out where this <a href=\"https://www.prevention.com/health/a32925734/why-do-my-burps-smell/\">belch-breath</a> was coming from. It tastes like I took some very strong medicine. The weirdest soft drink I've ever had. But it kind of grows on you. I'll try another one and let you know how it goes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"bc19d26e0f360e73217a8f4a6a3fdedc0b131ac74980c1224842a357fcb00133","category":"default"}
