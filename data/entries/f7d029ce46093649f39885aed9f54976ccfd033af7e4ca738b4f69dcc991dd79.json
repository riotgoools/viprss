The idea for the book came about when Pollack jotted down financial advice that works for almost everyone on a 4x6 index card.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>Now, Pollack teams up with Olen to explain why the ten simple rules of the index card outperform more complicated financial strategies. Inside is an easy-to-follow action plan that works in good times and bad, giving you the tools, knowledge, and confidence to seize control of your financial life.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>I learned about their book from a piece by Oliver Burkeman on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/mar/04/complex-questions-simple-answers-oliver-burkeman\">why complex questions can have simple answers</a>.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>But there’s a powerful truth here, which is that people dispensing financial advice are even less neutral than we realise. We’re good at spotting the obvious conflicts of interest: of course mortgage providers always think it’s a great time to buy a house; of course the sharp-suited guys from SpeedyMoola.co.uk think their payday loans are good value. But it’s more difficult to see that everyone offering advice has a deeper vested interest: they need you to believe things are complex enough to make their assistance worthwhile. It’s hard to make a living as a financial adviser by handing clients an index card and telling them never to return; and those stock-tipping columns in newspapers would be dull if all they ever said was “ignore stock tips”. Yes, the world of finance is complex, but it doesn’t follow that you need a complex strategy to navigate it.</p>\n\n<p>There’s no reason to assume this situation only occurs with money, either. The human body is another staggeringly complex system, but based on current science, Michael Pollan’s seven-word guidance — “Eat food, not too much, mostly plants” — is probably wiser than all other diets.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Burkeman wrote one of my <a href=\"http://kottke.org/15/06/happiness-for-people-who-cant-stand-positive-thinking\">favorite</a> books from the past year, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0865478015/ref=nosim/0sil8\">The Antidote: Happiness for People Who Can’t Stand Positive Thinking</a>.</p>\n\n         <p><em>[This is a vintage post originally from Mar 2016.]</em></p>\n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/books\">books</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/finance\">finance</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Harold%20Pollack\">Harold Pollack</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Helaine%20Olen\">Helaine Olen</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/money\">money</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Oliver%20Burkeman\">Oliver Burkeman</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/The%20Index%20Card\">The Index Card</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/timeless%20posts\">timeless posts</a></p>\n\n        \n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"f7d029ce46093649f39885aed9f54976ccfd033af7e4ca738b4f69dcc991dd79","category":"default"}
