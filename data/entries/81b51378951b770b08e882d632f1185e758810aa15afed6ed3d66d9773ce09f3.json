A long time ago you <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20070517142407/http://www.xmlrpc.com/stories/storyReader$1265\">said</a> XML-RPC, something I worked on, is Unix-like. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>XML-RPC, in particular, is very much in the Unix spirit. It's deliberately minimalist but nevertheless quite powerful, offering a way for the vast majority of RPC applications that can get by on passing around boolean/integer/float/string datatypes to do their thing in a way that is lightweight and easy to to understand and monitor. This simple type ontology acts as a valuable check on interface complexity.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It's very true, my design goal for my whole 50+ year career has been to factor my code so well so it was as clean as Unix is, from top to bottom</p>\n<p>The virtue of relentless factoring is you can build higher if each layer of the stack lets through the functionality that's needed, and no more. Ideally there should be one way of doing something. and it should work pretty well. </p>\n<p>I realized that the web, RSS and podcasting are also a Unix-like things. </p>\n<p>Because they can be made to do anything, but are  simple, not a lot to understand.</p>\n<p>But -- there's been this huge proliferation of languages and frameworks, and incredibly complex and underspecified formats. </p>\n<p>Meanwhile core functions like storage combined with identity for end users, has not been implemented, because of course if the users had their own networked data independent of any platform vendor there would be no lockin. that's 2024 version of the cathedral, to follow your analogy.</p>\n<p>Anyway, seeing you here made me think of this, I've wanted to say this to you for a long to you and now I have. ;-)</p>\n<p>PS: The <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20070517142407/http://www.xmlrpc.com/stories/storyReader$1265\">2001 email</a> from Eric Raymond.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"81b51378951b770b08e882d632f1185e758810aa15afed6ed3d66d9773ce09f3","category":"default"}
