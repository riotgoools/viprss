And now the video essay is on YouTube:</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>Itâ€™s a quick one about the sustained two-shot, a type of shot that was used a lot in the olden days but still has its uses today â€” and gives actors room to actually act.</p>\n\n<p>So happy to see Ramos and Zhou back at it. Iâ€™m not sure if I should even say this, but they indicated during their XOXO appearance that there will be more to come (in fewer than 8 years).</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://kottke.org/17/12/rip-every-frame-a-painting\">Hereâ€™s my post about them shuttering the channel and a few of my favorite videos of theirs</a>.</p>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/film%20school\">film school</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/movies\">movies</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Taylor%20Ramos\">Taylor Ramos</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Tony%20Zhou\">Tony Zhou</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/video\">video</a></p>\n\n         <p>ðŸ’¬ <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/08/-new-every-frame-a-painting\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> â†’</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"c59e5ea34f7cf91c0ec4eff3d32e5b8f405dcfacbd6238065b8f0a37f93773c9","category":"Sites"}
