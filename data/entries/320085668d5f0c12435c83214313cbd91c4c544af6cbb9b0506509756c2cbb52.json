Let’s dig right in.\nFirst, I’m running a new pop-up newsletter connected with my upcoming Tōkaidō walk. The newsletter is called The Return to Pachinko Road and you can sign up here. It starts on May 14, ends on June 1st-ish. I’ll be walking some 600 kilometers from Kyoto to Tokyo and, as usual, publishing a daily essay with photographs.\nI haven’t done a walk + newsletter of this length in … a long time.","author":"","siteTitle":"Craig Mod","siteHash":"7358923c3192bccfb6b9f0032f475bef5140f12de0f235c80ca3d98e1a3d393b","entryHash":"320085668d5f0c12435c83214313cbd91c4c544af6cbb9b0506509756c2cbb52","category":"Sites"}
