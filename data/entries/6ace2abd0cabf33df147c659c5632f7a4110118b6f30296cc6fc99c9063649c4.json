Itâ€™s also the same room where I have worked for decades in the middle of the energy which New York City itself has brought to me. The listener may hear the quiet hum of New York in the background or feel the influence of time and memory that this space affords. To the degree possible, I made this record to invite the listener in.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>And hereâ€™s a video of him playing the albumâ€™s opening piece on his 87th birthday:</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>You can stream the album on <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/5EOmS6QX7WJq1041EcadSR?si=U9KDbQfuRX2DWF4fEoogwQ\">Spotify</a>, <a href=\"https://music.apple.com/us/album/philip-glass-solo/1715518800\">Apple Music</a>, or <a href=\"https://philipglass.bandcamp.com/album/philip-glass-solo\">Bandcamp</a>.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>You can buy the album <a href=\"https://philipglass.bandcamp.com/album/philip-glass-solo\">at Bandcamp</a> or <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0CP89PM1V/ref=nosim/0sil8\">on vinyl at Amazon</a>.</p>\n\n <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/music\">music</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Philip%20Glass\">Philip Glass</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/video\">video</a></p>\n\n <p>ðŸ’¬ <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/04/todays-work-music-philip-glass-solo\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> â†’</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"6ace2abd0cabf33df147c659c5632f7a4110118b6f30296cc6fc99c9063649c4","category":"default"}
