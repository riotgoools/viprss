her entire published corpus, from 1956 to 2021, totalled fifty-eight books, while she edited a further five volumes.</p>\r\n<p>Posterity will remember Jan Morris.  What makes her work <em>sui generis</em> is the genre-less way that she combined topography, the social landscape, history, personal anecdote, and an acute imagination.  Morris forged an unlikely style that was vigorous, precise, and entertaining.  Hers was a language nourished by the music of childhood, conditioned by <em>The Book of Common Prayer</em> and Shakespeare, energised by journalism, and inspired by travelling the world as a student of human nature.  Like all writers, Morris had her foibles: her voluptuous vocabulary included words such as ‘tatterdemalion,’ ‘swagger,’ ‘gallimaufry,’ ‘coruscate,’ ‘fizz,’ ‘parvenu,’ ‘rodomontade,’ ‘gasconade,’ ‘palimpset,’ ‘simulacrum,’ ‘fandango,’ and ‘chimerical.’  The three Morris m’s — magnificent, melancholy, and myriad — ripple through her work, not forgetting her love of the two Welsh h’s —<em>hwyl</em> and <em>hiraeth</em>.  Her writing could be indulgent at times, but Morris did not take an exalted view of herself as a writer.  She was the one who called her work, in <em>A Writer’s World</em>, ‘hedonistic,’ ‘boisterous,’ and ‘impertinent,’  In a newspaper questionnaire in 1998, Morris was asked how she would like to be remembered, and she replied: ‘As a merry and loving writer.’</p></blockquote>\r\n<p>As an aside, not all those words cited seem so weird to this writer.  Swagger, fizz, and parvenu are in ordinary usage, chimerical too.</p>\r\n<p>Among its other virtues, I feel this book captures British history and British intellectual history very well.  In any case, you can buy the book <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.amazon.com/Jan-Morris-Life-Both-Sides/dp/195035492X/ref=sr_1_1?crid=38CNUEY5P0ACS&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.yKGwb93qDVgSpPAbvI3FA-RBmt30-27iIbX6q1ie013raNnswvVA2S72Rjyp_EufGOiXkGIgYjeuStaYZvDYcVKu06CAmG4i00WbQw1v9BwtaMsxcE3gDk5p7l6N_nXjHZjuj20WVsbvbb7ROO6BoUyFng7sgjdMWUTbLrO0IZ_UY2rY0bMrD5iLCZW4KQTzxJhEP93DjvVVt9AIzYi4jgZ01m-ImoIbOobq84Cuji0.X-LIZR2tRhO-Vp-6_j6xks7hgwKkdMKWJuH7rBFaG8E&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=paul+clements&amp;qid=1718867363&amp;sprefix=paul+clements%2Caps%2C231&amp;sr=8-1\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>, and I have ordered some additional Morris works to read.  If I really like any of them, I will let you all know.</p>\r\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/06/jan-morris-life-from-both-sides.html\">*Jan Morris: life from both sides*</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com\">Marginal REVOLUTION</a>.</p>\r\n<img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/899804150/0/marginalrevolution\" />\r\n<div><a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/899804150/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/899804150/marginalrevolution,\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/899804150/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/x.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/899804150/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/899804150/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/06/jan-morris-life-from-both-sides.html#comments\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/comments20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/06/jan-morris-life-from-both-sides.html/feed\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/commentsrss20.png\" /></a> \r\n<div><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/06/jan-morris-life-from-both-sides.html#comments\"><h3>Comments</h3></a><ul><li><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/06/jan-morris-life-from-both-sides.html#comment-160771308\">If “swagger” was an obscure word a few decades ago, then ...</a> <i>by Ricardo</i></li><li><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/06/jan-morris-life-from-both-sides.html#comment-160771307\">In reply to mento.   an absolutely terrible list</a> <i>by .</i></li><li><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/06/jan-morris-life-from-both-sides.html#comment-160771306\">In reply to Steve Sailer.
