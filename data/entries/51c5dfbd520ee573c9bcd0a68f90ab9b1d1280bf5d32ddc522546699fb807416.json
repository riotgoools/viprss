Anyone who is a parent or caregiver can relate to the destruction on display here, as well as the difficulty of replacing these items.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>I show old, much-loved teddies and dolls and compare them with as good as new doppelgangers. I think the broken stuffed animals have a lot of soul. The project is inspired by my older daughter, who took her plush dog everywhere when she was little. One day I found this dog again without button eye and torn seams in the store and bought it. She did not like him. The old one was better and could not be replaced.</p></blockquote>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Katja%20Kemnitz\">Katja Kemnitz</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/photography\">photography</a></p>\n\n         <p>ðŸ’¬ <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/10/stuffies-lovies-that-have-been-loved-too-much\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> â†’</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"51c5dfbd520ee573c9bcd0a68f90ab9b1d1280bf5d32ddc522546699fb807416","category":"Sites"}
