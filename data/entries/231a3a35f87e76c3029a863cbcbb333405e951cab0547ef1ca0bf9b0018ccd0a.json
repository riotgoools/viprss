For instance, here are Buckingham Palace and Westminster:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/plus/misc/images/uk-car-optimized-01.jpg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" alt=\"Buckingham Palace in the midst of a huge parking lot\" /></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/plus/misc/images/uk-car-optimized-02.jpg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" alt=\"The Palace of Westminster with massive expressways running through it\" /></p>\n\n<p>Writes Branchesi:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>Amidst a political landscape where the ‘war on motorists’ is wielded as a populist tool, this series captures a future where this rhetoric has prevailed. The transformation of UK landmarks like Stonehenge into vast vehicular realms underscores the absurdity and danger of prioritizing short-term political gains over sustainable urban planning. These images mirror the contentious debates in the UK, challenging the narrative that prioritizes car ownership at the expense of public health and environmental sustainability.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Of course, in an America engineered by Robert Moses and his acolytes, many of those images don’t even look that far-fetched.</p>\n\n        \n\n <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/cars\">cars</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/cities\">cities</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Kyle%20Branchesi\">Kyle Branchesi</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/remix\">remix</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/UK\">UK</a></p>\n\n <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/02/what-would-a-car-optimized-hellscape-look-like-in-the-uk\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"231a3a35f87e76c3029a863cbcbb333405e951cab0547ef1ca0bf9b0018ccd0a","category":"default"}
