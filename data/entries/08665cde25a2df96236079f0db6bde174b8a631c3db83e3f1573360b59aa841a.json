{"title":"My Conversation with the excellent Paula Byrne","link":"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/909311159/0/marginalrevolution~My-Conversation-with-the-excellent-Paula-Byrne.html","date":1734068768000,"content":"<p>Here is <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://conversationswithtyler.com/episodes/paula-byrne/\" target=\"_blank\">the audio, video, and transcript</a>.  Here is part of the episode summary:</p>\r\n<blockquote><p>Tyler and Paula discuss Virginia Woolf’s surprising impressions of Hardy, why Wessex has lost a sense of its past, what <em>Jude the Obscure</em> reveals about Hardy’s ideas about marriage, why so many Hardy tragedies come in doubles, the best least-read Hardy novels, why Mary Robinson was the most interesting woman of her day, how Georgian theater shaped Jane Austen’s writing, British fastidiousness, Evelyn Waugh’s hidden warmth, Paula’s strange experience with poison pen letters, how American and British couples are different, the mental health crisis among teenagers, the most underrated Beatles songs, the weirdest thing about living in Arizona, and more.</p></blockquote>\r\n<p>This was one of the most fun — and funny — CWTs of all time.  But those parts are best experienced in context, so I’ll give you an excerpt of something else:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Your book on Evelyn Waugh, the phrase pops up, and I quote, “naturally fastidious.” Why can it be said that so many British people are naturally fastidious?</p>\r\n<p><strong>BYRNE: </strong>Your questions are so crazy. I love it. Did I say that? [laughs]</p>\r\n<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>I think Evelyn Waugh said it, not you. It’s in the book.</p>\r\n<p><strong>BYRNE: </strong>Give me the context of that.</p>\r\n<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Oh, I’d have to go back and look. It’s just in my memory.</p>\r\n<p><strong>BYRNE: </strong>That’s really funny. It’s a great phrase.</p>\r\n<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>We can evaluate the claim on its own terms, right?</p>\r\n<p><strong>BYRNE: </strong>Yes, we can.</p>\r\n<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>I’m not sure they are anymore. It seems maybe they once were, but the stiff-upper-lip tradition seems weaker with time.</p>\r\n<p><strong>BYRNE: </strong>The stiff upper lip. Yes, I think Evelyn Waugh would be appalled with the way England has gone. Naturally fastidious, yes, it’s different to reticent, isn’t it? Fastidious — hard to please, it means, doesn’t it? Naturally hard to please. I think that’s quite true, certainly of Evelyn Waugh because he was naturally fastidious. That literally sums him up in a phrase.</p>\r\n<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>If I go to Britain as an American, I very much have the feeling that people derive status from having negative opinions more than positive. That’s quite different from this country. Would you agree with that?</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Definitely recommended, one of my favorite episodes in some while.  And of course we got around to discussing Paul McCartney and Liverpool…</p>\r\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/12/my-conversation-with-the-excellent-paula-byrne.html\">My Conversation with the excellent Paula Byrne</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com\">Marginal REVOLUTION</a>.</p>\r\n<img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/909311159/0/marginalrevolution\" />\r\n<div><a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/909311159/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/909311159/marginalrevolution,\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/909311159/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/x.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/909311159/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/909311159/marginalrevolution\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/12/my-conversation-with-the-excellent-paula-byrne.html#comments\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/comments20.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/12/my-conversation-with-the-excellent-paula-byrne.html/feed\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/commentsrss20.png\" /></a> \r\n<div><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/12/my-conversation-with-the-excellent-paula-byrne.html#comments\"><h3>Comments</h3></a><ul><li><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/12/my-conversation-with-the-excellent-paula-byrne.html#comment-160846198\">In reply to M.
