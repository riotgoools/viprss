To have any kind of productive conversation, we have to get over that defensiveness that so many men feel whenever they they come across the word “patriarchy”. Contrary to popular belief, patriarchy is not a synonym for men, nor is it a code word for masculinity, and it certainly has nothing to do with hating men.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>The bibliography in the description of the video lists three books if you’d like to do some reading on the topic:</p>\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1439911843/ref=nosim/0sil8\">The Gender Knot: Unraveling Our Patriarchal Legacy</a> by Allan G Johnson.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0743456084/ref=nosim/0sil8\">The Will to Change: Men, Masculinity, and Love</a> by bell hooks.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0520246985/ref=nosim/0sil8\">Masculinities</a> by R.

The channel is challenging the takedown and has uploaded it to <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/104004592\">Patreon</a> and <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/patriarchy-according-to-the-barbie-movie\">archive.org</a> in the meantime. (I’m leaving the embed in case it comes back to life.) This bullshit is so irritating — Google just totally letting massive media corporations decide what’s copyright infringing without recourse. And Warner (and Gerwig &amp; Robbie too to some lesser extent)…you made the fucking movie to get a message across and to get people talking and someone posts a thoughtful video essay about the central issue of the film and you fucking take it down?</p>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Barbie\">Barbie</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/feminism\">feminism</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/movies\">movies</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/video\">video</a></p>\n\n        \n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"c757b728713eeae275a6f6735bdc7aed960da71ae12a80d7dde96343b20ce3e5","category":"default"}
