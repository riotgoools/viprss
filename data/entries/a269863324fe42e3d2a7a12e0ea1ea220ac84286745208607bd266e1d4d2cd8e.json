This includes understanding their beliefs, desires, intentions, and emotions. It also involves using this information to explain and predict human behavior.</p>\n<p>What could go wrong? Emergent (actual) example: agents that have agency and inferring via ToM your intent.</p>\n<p>There is the fact that <strong>intent is not action, and inferring is not understanding.</strong> This is where we are headed.</p>\n<p><strong>TL/DR : Intent is not action; to plan is not to do. Inferring is not understanding; it invites errors.</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>","author":"MDG","siteTitle":"Mark Ghuneim","siteHash":"fbdbfb355dab5247b3a3d9c04401313e99252873a1ae0fb1ea729c2e5736c6f3","entryHash":"a269863324fe42e3d2a7a12e0ea1ea220ac84286745208607bd266e1d4d2cd8e","category":"default"}
