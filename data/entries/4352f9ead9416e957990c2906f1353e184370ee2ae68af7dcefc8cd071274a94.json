Iâ€™ve selected a few of my favorites above. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amiteshel.com/\">Amit Eshel</a> took the photo of the ibex:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>After hiking to a clifftop vantage point, Amit slowly crept closer. Using a wide-angle lens, he set the action of two clashing Nubian ibex against the dramatic backdrop. The battle lasted for about 15 minutes before one male surrendered and the pair parted without serious injury.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/sriram_murali/\">Sriram Murali</a> captured the jungle lit up by fireflies:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>Sriram combined 50 individual 19-second exposures to show the firefly flashes produced over 16 minutes in the forests of the Anamalai Tiger Reserve near his hometown. He watched as pinpoint flashes appeared in the treetops increasing in number as they spread down along the branches until something remarkable happened. Synchronising, they pulsated through the canopy like a wave â€” the pattern punctuated with sequences of abrupt on-off bursts in unison.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>The happy turtle photo is by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/tzahi_finkelstein/\">Tzahi Finkelstein</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>This dragonfly unexpectedly landed on the turtleâ€™s nose but instead of the turtle snapping up the insect, it appeared to be experiencing pleasure from the interaction as they shared a moment of peaceful coexistence amid a swampâ€™s murky waters.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>(via <a href=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/2024/01/2023-wildlife-photography-contest/\">colossal</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/photo/2024/02/peoples-choice-wildlife-photographer-of-the-year-2023/677372/\">in focus</a>)</p>\n\n        \n\n <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/best%20of\">best of</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/best%20of%202024\">best of 2024</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/photography\">photography</a></p>\n\n <p>ðŸ’¬ <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/02/winners-of-the-59th-annual-wildlife-photographer-of-the-year-contest\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> â†’</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"4352f9ead9416e957990c2906f1353e184370ee2ae68af7dcefc8cd071274a94","category":"default"}
