I built it while I was spending December in <a href=\"https://keningzhu.com/santorini\">santorini</a> — just after my 30th birthday — and just before moving to Istanbul. this offering was literally born as <a href=\"https://keningzhu.com/journal/a-house-on-an-island\" target=\"_blank\">a house on an island.</a></p><p>so much has changed then. after settling in Istanbul, I met my current partner, and my dog Luna. I’ve found so much more integration between my artist and business selves, and I’ve deepened in world-building as an essential practice. </p><p>then, despite several <em>forced</em> jump-starts over these last three years, I let this course totally hibernate — while my own philosophies were deepening and expanding, and as I was becoming more of a rooted being. more <em>myself</em>. </p><p></p><p><strong>course as a living ecosystem </strong></p><p>in the past, my pattern with teaching creative courses is that I tend to over-give to them — and to my students — and inevitably burn out. because I’m exhausted and bored from teaching the same curriculum, again and again, I subsequently ghost my own course. or, I’ve spent a gazillion hours on the creation part, and I’m too tired to do any marketing or promotion or traditional “launching” for it. then, after a few months or half a year passes, some perfectionism kicks in and I don’t want to look at it, or think about it again. </p><p>this time, I thought concretely about these challenges before beginning — and decided that I needed to prioritize <strong>ongoing / aliveness &amp; creative energetics.</strong> </p><p>I needed to keep my course alive — or I’ll be bored, and eventually, I’ll want to kill it. I also needed to be extremely cognizant of my energy input and output, in order to make the course its own ecosystem that can nourish me, and be nourished by me. avoiding burnout and boredom is the key. </p><p>thus, my intention for this course is to use it as a creative container — a multi-form artistic space to offer my focused guidance. as a form, it will be not unlike my website. except this time, it’s a gated labyrinth. a carefully designed, curated journey. </p><p>I’m thinking of myself as an adventure tour guide through the possibilities of the internet wild. </p><p></p><p><strong>work in progress</strong></p><p>in the last 3 days <em>(my sprint, part 1)</em>, I spent 14 hours mapping out a plan, re-writing, and re-recording the <a href=\"https://keningzhu.notion.site/House-on-the-Webs-Introduction-5c22f966677342b7b7250848a463cb03\" target=\"_blank\">introduction of the course</a>. then, I thought through the digital systems and tools that I’ll be using for this course. </p><ul><li><p>I decided to continue hosting the entire course on Notion</p></li><li><p>I deleted my website course page, and replaced it with, basically, what serves the function of <a href=\"https://keningzhu.com/house-on-the-webs\">a portal door</a>.  </p></li><li><p>after creating the introduction page and deciding to make that public, I realized that I don’t actually need a course \"sales” page, afterall. </p></li><li><p>instead, I starting drafting a simple <a href=\"https://keningzhu.notion.site/House-on-the-Webs-Registration-889e28ae0c3b4915b83f77dc019ce338?pvs=4\" target=\"_blank\">registration page</a>. <br /></p></li></ul><h1><br />notion as ecosystem </h1><p>I’m really excited about using Notion as the home for my inner labyrinth / course ecosystem. here’s a table of contents I built for the <a href=\"https://keningzhu.notion.site/House-on-the-Webs-Introduction-5c22f966677342b7b7250848a463cb03\" target=\"_blank\">Course Introduction</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure>\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/51e8148de4b01c1eb79c1977/84e76ccb-50f6-4db8-8914-030912f8ade5/Screenshot+2024-08-22+at+9.59.59%E2%80%AFPM.png?format=1000w\" width=\"1642\" height=\"1860\" srcset=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/51e8148de4b01c1eb79c1977/84e76ccb-50f6-4db8-8914-030912f8ade5/Screenshot+2024-08-22+at+9.59.59%E2%80%AFPM.png?format=100w 100w, https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/51e8148de4b01c1eb79c1977/84e76ccb-50f6-4db8-8914-030912f8ade5/Screenshot+2024-08-22+at+9.59.59%E2%80%AFPM.png?format=300w 300w, https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/51e8148de4b01c1eb79c1977/84e76ccb-50f6-4db8-8914-030912f8ade5/Screenshot+2024-08-22+at+9.59.59%E2%80%AFPM.png?format=500w 500w, https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/51e8148de4b01c1eb79c1977/84e76ccb-50f6-4db8-8914-030912f8ade5/Screenshot+2024-08-22+at+9.59.59%E2%80%AFPM.png?format=750w 750w, https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/51e8148de4b01c1eb79c1977/84e76ccb-50f6-4db8-8914-030912f8ade5/Screenshot+2024-08-22+at+9.59.59%E2%80%AFPM.png?format=1000w 1000w, https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/51e8148de4b01c1eb79c1977/84e76ccb-50f6-4db8-8914-030912f8ade5/Screenshot+2024-08-22+at+9.59.59%E2%80%AFPM.png?format=1500w 1500w, https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/51e8148de4b01c1eb79c1977/84e76ccb-50f6-4db8-8914-030912f8ade5/Screenshot+2024-08-22+at+9.59.59%E2%80%AFPM.png?format=2500w 2500w\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <h1>what’s next </h1><p>next week, I’ll be continuing to make content for each day of the course — and will launch Day 0 as a free offering.
