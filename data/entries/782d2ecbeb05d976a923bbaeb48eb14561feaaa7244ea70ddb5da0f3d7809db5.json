Government scientists have been documenting the size, shape, and movement of glaciers since the 1950s employing techniques ranging from direct field observations to aerial photography.</p>\n\n<p>The United States Geological Survey (USGS) has one of the largest collections of aerial glacier photographs. Over 40 years, the USGSâ€™ North American Glacier Aerial Photography (NAGAP) project captured thousands of striking high-resolution photos of glaciers and their surroundings.</p>\n\n<p>From 1960 to 1983, self-taught glaciologist Austin Post used a 63-pound World War II-era Fairchild K-17 aerial reconnaissance camera to shoot over 100,000 glacier photos in the western US and Alaska. One of the bush pilots Post teamed up with was William R. Fairchild, who flew a Beech 18 twin engine airplane equipped with five K-17 cameras-one mounted on the nose, two in the belly of the plane, and one on each side.</p></blockquote>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/climate%20crisis\">climate crisis</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Jon%20Keegan\">Jon Keegan</a> Â· <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/photography\">photography</a></p>\n\n         <p>ðŸ’¬ <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/06/a-massive-trove-of-aerial-photos-of-glaciers\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> â†’</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"782d2ecbeb05d976a923bbaeb48eb14561feaaa7244ea70ddb5da0f3d7809db5","category":"default"}
