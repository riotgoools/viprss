A couple of years ago, I was telling my therapist about some crisis I was going through and she told me something that’s had a profound effect on my life ever since: “Jason, what you’re feeling is appropriate for the developmental stage you’re in right now.”</p>\n\n<p>Reader, I was 49 years old. Developmental stages are typically associated with infants, children, and teens — we use them to mark their progress along the path to being adult humans. Adolescent growth is rapid and the transitions are stark; your appearance and capabilities change so much more between ages 3 and 10 than between 30 and 37 that adulthood can feel comparatively static. Even though people keep changing in adulthood, there is some sense in which people are fully baked by the time they reach 18-25 years old.</p>\n\n<p>When my therapist said “what you’re feeling is appropriate for the developmental stage you’re in right now”, it hit me right between the eyes and I knew exactly what she was trying to say. Our growth never ends. We never stop going through developmental stages — we just call them things like “becoming a parent”, “mid-life crisis”, or “perimenopause”. The pain, confusion, and emotional distress we experience is because <em>we’re growing</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Thinking about my life through this lens has flipped a switch for me. Internalizing “this is appropriate” and “I’m leveling up” provided me with a better alternative to “I’m almost 50, I don’t have my life figured out yet, what the hell is wrong with me?” Rewiring my thought process is still a work in progress, but I feel like it’s allowed me to approach challenges more as opportunities than as obstacles, provided me with a map/plan out of dark times, and given me more room to be easier on myself.</p>\n\n<p>(I hope that all makes sense. Personal epiphanies can be difficult to translate for others.)</p>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Jason%20Kottke\">Jason Kottke</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/therapy\">therapy</a></p>\n\n         <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/11/we-never-stop-growing\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"0a46e8719709d2392f8ab28cfc7f7a656a48fbf60e5145741ea20f0dd400f17b","category":"Sites"}
