The latest episode was a re-broadcast of <a href=\"https://freakonomics.com/podcast/update-john-greens-reluctant-rocket-ship-ride/\">his interview with John Green</a>, who, prior to this interview, I didn’t really know anything about. I looked him up and realized he’s the brother of <a href=\"https://hankgreen.com/\">Hank Green</a>, who I sort of knew from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@vlogbrothers\">YouTube</a>. So anyway, yeah, somehow I missed John Green, which feels weird for a very online person. I guess I need to read <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3RaB0GM\">his books</a> with my kids.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"micro.brad","siteHash":"27daae1c149c6ec5a964b1fe9266f5a58f96cfb4b36e39006f255c6b2b53a76d","entryHash":"f88d99a816da19b1cf47a075d7e2aaeef3da5cea42d26aba23a341f256ec4b16","category":"default"}
