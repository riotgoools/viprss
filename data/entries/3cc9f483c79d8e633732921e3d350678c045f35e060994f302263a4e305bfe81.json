He didn’t know about the fish doorbell, but he did used to be an intern at the <a href=\"https://www.museumspeelklok.nl/lang/en/\">Musical Clock Museum</a> in Utrecht, which is a museum focusing on self-playing instruments and musical clocks. The Museum Speelklok appears to contain the second largest such collection in the world behind the <a href=\"https://www.musicalmuseum.co.uk\">Musical Museum in Brentford</a>, which has them beat on self-playing instruments, though it’s not clear how many musical clocks they’ve got at MM. Regardless, the Utrecht Musical Clock Museum appears delightful and you should visit after visiting the fish doorbell.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong><br />\nThanks to Logan and Marc in the comments for pointing me to <a href=\"https://wintergatan.net\">Wintergatan</a>.
