{"title":"Year in Review","link":"https://blog.webb.page/2018-12-31-year-in-review.txt","date":1546214400000,"content":"<p>So much has happened this year, not just for me but my wife as well. Let's dig\nin.</p>\n<h2>I quit Instagram</h2>\n<p>A year prior I quit Facebook proper but it seemed disingenuous to continue\nusing Instagram. Knowing that I was still in FB Land made me feel gross so my\nlast post was New Years Day.</p>\n<h2>Attained Wakandan Citizenship</h2>\n<p>Black Panther was the greatest movie of the year. I want Kimoyo Beads<a href=\"http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Kimoyo_Beads\">1</a>\n<em>badly</em>.</p>\n<h2>Moved to Tennessee</h2>\n<p>Family friends invited us to stay with them while 1) I found a new job and 2)\nwe found a home of our own. I <em>would not</em> recommend this as it was stressful in\nseveral annoying ways but it was only four months. Lessons learned?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Trust your gut (in hindsight, I should have seen my layoff coming)</li>\n<li>Have a savings fund</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Got more serious about projects</h2>\n<p>Socii<a href=\"https://socii.network\">2</a> saw improvements, Chew<a href=\"https://chew.sh\">3</a> was launched, and I released some\nopen-source<a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/vne\">4</a> modules<a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/chewit\">5</a> and<a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/@inc/eslint-config\">6</a> configs<a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/@inc/sasslint-config\">7</a> on npm.</p>\n<p>Along the way, I discovered better \"good practices\" and I'm keen on improving\nthem further in the new year.</p>\n<p>Oh, and I transitioned from GitLab to Gitea<a href=\"https://gitea.io\">8</a>. GitLab is a resource hog and\nreminds of old Wordpress. I am much happier with Gitea and it is customizable!\nI haven't done any customization though, haha.</p>\n<p>My wife delved into sewing more, improved her skills tenfold, and is becoming\nknown in the sewing community. I now have intermediate knowledge about cover\nstiches and what stiches look like when using 1-3 needles.</p>\n<h2>Bought more indie music</h2>\n<p>Stream life is just not for me, at least music-wise. Tidal, Spotify,\nApple Musicâ€¦none of it sticks with me. I've found myself using Bandcamp a lot\nmore this year and I mean a LOT.</p>\n<p>Some awesome musicians I've discovered are LAKIM<a href=\"https://lakimisalive.bandcamp.com\">9</a>, ãƒžã‚¯ãƒ­ã‚¹MACROSS 82-99<a href=\"https://macross82-99.bandcamp.com\">10</a>,\nEric Lau<a href=\"https://ericlau.bandcamp.com\">11</a>, Dent May<a href=\"https://dentmay.bandcamp.com\">12</a>, The PLAYlist<a href=\"https://theplaylist.bandcamp.com\">13</a>, leon chang<a href=\"https://leyawn.bandcamp.com\">14</a>, YUNG BAE<a href=\"https://yungbaebae.bandcamp.com\">15</a>â€¦I\ncould keep going but that small list should keep your ears busy for a couple\nhours.</p>\n<h2>FIN</h2>\n<p>For the past couple years I've ended my annual review posts with my top nine\npopular Instagram posts but since I don't use that platform anymoreâ€¦here are\nsome favorited images from my phone.</p>\n<p>ðŸ“¸<a href=\"https://%F0%9F%94%A5.pixels.wtf/blog/image/2018/yir.jpg\">My favorite photos from the past few months</a></p>\n<p>This time next year, Socii will have photo functionality. ðŸ•¸</p>\n<hr />\n<hr />\n","author":"","siteTitle":"the webb blog","siteHash":"d87386c8de21b16d23a4d22ceb0991728c5b4e4486d627490c6fcde14e563300","entryHash":"a05f9b6a13958097aa994a69a881b400d8e6e4ae7a9cca04b236c6f2c8222a44","category":"Sites"}
