{"title":"I Just Wasn&#8217;t Very Good","link":"https://kottke.org/24/04/what-is-bad-art","date":1713467432000,"content":"\n        <p>I’ve been thinking about <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/04/adam-moss-and-the-creative-process\">something I posted</a> last week — in an excerpt from his new book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0CC1D55VJ/ref=nosim/0sil8\">The Work of Art</a>, former New York magazine editor Adam Moss described the art he makes as bad: “When I left my job, I began to paint more seriously,” <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/04/adam-moss-and-the-creative-process\">he wrote</a>. “That was the beginning of my torment: I just wasn’t very good.” Or as he put it to <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2024/04/22/the-evanescent-art-of-the-sandcastle\">The New Yorker</a>: “I kind of just wasn’t any good.” Or to <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/adam-moss-new-york-magazine-book\">Vanity Fair</a>: “I really wanted to be a good painter. What a fucking idiot I was.” Or on <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/04/16/1245150280/whats-the-key-to-creating-great-art-this-author-spoke-to-40-artists-to-find-out\">NPR</a>, “I really wanted to be good, and it made the act of making art so frustrating for me.”</p>\n\n<p>The book is mostly about how other artists make their work, but I’m currently more interested in what Moss has to say about himself and his art. </p>\n\n<p>Later in the VF and NPR interviews, Moss says that the main lesson he learned from making the book is that with art, it’s the journey not the destination — or, “the making, not the made” (“It’s the most banal observation”) — but of course I still went looking for his paintings online. I want to see them! I didn’t find anything (per the VF article, he hasn’t shared anything publicly yet), but to Moss I say: Show them! Maybe it doesn’t matter if they’re not good. Maybe the worse, the better. </p>\n\n <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Adam%20Moss\">Adam Moss</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/art\">art</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/books\">books</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/creative%20processes\">creative processes</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/painting\">painting</a></p>\n\n <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/04/what-is-bad-art\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Edith Zimmerman","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"4e7f7f08f6c9df3ca82fbd02fc655f4b4b35ec3fc3f7f6184027b7c9d9e687b6","category":"default"}
