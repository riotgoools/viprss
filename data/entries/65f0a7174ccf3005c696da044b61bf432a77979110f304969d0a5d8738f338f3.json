This way, I can switch back and forth without feeling like I am abandoning one book for the other. Right now, I am most of the way through <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=25361&amp;awinaffid=1677195&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Flibro.fm%2Faudiobooks%2F9780593821251\">James by Percival Everett on audiobook</a> and just (finally!) started <a href=\"https://shop.specialprojects.jp/products/things-become-other-things-1st-ed\">Craig Modâ€™s fine-art edition of Things Become Other Things</a>. (Both are about very different kinds of journeys.)</p>\n\n<p>For the last three years, Iâ€™ve been been getting my audiobooks through <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=25361&amp;awinaffid=1677195&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Flibro.fm\">Libro.fm</a>. You can listen through their app or download DRM-free mp3 or m4b files to listen in the app of your choice. They are a social purpose corporation, 100% employee owned, and partner with local bookstores to offer audiobooks &amp; share profits. They donâ€™t have every title because of Audibleâ€™s strategy of locking up exclusives (like Emily Wilsonâ€™s translations of The Iliad and the Odyssey), but they have most of what youâ€™d want to read. They also make it easy to <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=25361&amp;awinaffid=1677195&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Flibro.fm%2Fgift\">gift audiobooks</a> to friends and family (and I suppose, enemies and strangers if you want?)</p>\n\n<p>Just in the past few months, Iâ€™ve listened to:</p>\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=25361&amp;awinaffid=1677195&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Flibro.fm%2Faudiobooks%2F9780593828977\">All Fours</a> by Miranda July. This is one of those books thatâ€™s better as an audiobook. July is an actress as well as an author and the audiobook is more like a performance than a reading.</li>\n\n<p><li><a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=25361&amp;awinaffid=1677195&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Flibro.fm%2Faudiobooks%2F9780593821251\">James</a> by Percival Everett. Already mentioned this one, but the narration by Dominic Hoffman is superb and emphasizes some of the vernacular differences that are key to the story that might be tougher to express in print. (Hoffman also narrated James McBrideâ€™s <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=25361&amp;awinaffid=1677195&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Flibro.fm%2Faudiobooks%2F9780593166987\">Deacon King Kong</a> and Ted Chiangâ€™s <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=25361&amp;awinaffid=1677195&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Flibro.fm%2Faudiobooks%2F9781984844453\">Exhalation</a>.)</li></p>\n\n<p><li><a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=25361&amp;awinaffid=1677195&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Flibro.fm%2Faudiobooks%2F9781508278511\">Midnight in Chernobyl</a> by Adam Higginbotham. This is the definitive account of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant disaster and a great companion to HBOâ€™s Chernobyl miniseries.</li></p>\n\n<p><li><a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=25361&amp;awinaffid=1677195&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Flibro.fm%2Faudiobooks%2F9781478952947\">The First Fifteen Lives of Harry August</a> by Claire North. A fun sci-fi story that presents an alternative version of Groundhog Day-style time travel.</li></p></ul><p></p>\n\n<p>You can purchase individual audiobooks through the site or <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=25361&amp;awinaffid=1677195&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Flibro.fm/membership\">sign up for a membership</a> where you get one free credit a month and each credit to good for one audiobook, regardless of price.</p>\n\n<p>When you buy through links on kottke.org, I may earn an affiliate commission.
