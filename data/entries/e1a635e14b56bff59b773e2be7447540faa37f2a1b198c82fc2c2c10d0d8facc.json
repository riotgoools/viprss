It’s not. It’s a living fact, like biodiversity in rain forests. We clearly have people with many different kinds of minds. There are people with dyslexia, there are people with ADHD, there are people with autism, there are people at all points of the spectrum. And all of these labels are the names of “disorders,” but <em>if you look at them another way, they’re just different kinds of human operating systems</em>.</p>\n\n<p>We have to get beyond the fact that these conditions were discovered by people looking for forms of illness, basically, and recognize that they’re just there. They’re part of the human fabric. They always have been. People with these conditions have been making contributions to the evolution of science, art and technology for centuries — invisibly, mostly. You know, most of the labels were invented in the 20th century. <em>We have to start looking at those labels, instead of the checklist of modern disorders, as human resources that we have not learned to tap fully because we’ve been so busy treating those people like carriers of disorder.</em></p></blockquote>\n\n<p>You can read <a href=\"https://www.salon.com/2015/09/19/were_still_dealing_with_autism_like_its_this_wacky_historical_aberration_steve_silberman_on_the_truth_about_autism/\">the full 2015 interview with Silberman</a> from which that passage was pulled.</p>\n\n<p>P.S.
