I always wanted to learn how to play guitar and last year my son and I started taking guitar lessons together and now I can sort of play guitar a little.</p>\n\n<p>If youâ€™re trying to convince yourself to learn something you should just do it because you might still be shitty at whatever youâ€™re learning 6 months from now, but youâ€™ll be much better than youâ€™d be if you didnâ€™t start until 6 months from now. I think I saw someone say this more eloquently (obviously), but when I tried to find it, all I could find was someone saying imagine if you started 6 months ago, which I think is a recipe for making yourself feel bad, and I bet you donâ€™t need any help doing that, do you?</p>\n\n<p>So, whatâ€™d you learn how to do this year or if you havenâ€™t learned anything new yet, what are you going to start learning how to do this year? </p>\n\n\n\n <p>ðŸ’¬ <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/03/what-did-you-learn-how-to-do-this-year\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> â†’</p>\n\n    ","author":"Aaron Cohen","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"05f348537137a590683177a24bd31508597413218ea32a45a89b99292f1aa468","category":"default"}
