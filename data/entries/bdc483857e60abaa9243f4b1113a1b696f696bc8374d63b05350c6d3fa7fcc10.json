(Maybe.)</p>\n\n<p>There are so many mind-blowing things about eclipses but the one I can‚Äôt stop thinking about is the nearly impossible coincidence that the sun and the moon are the same relative size in the sky. If the moon were a little bit smaller or farther away, we wouldn‚Äôt have total eclipses where you can look directly at the sun, see the corona, the sky goes dark, you see a sunset effect all around the horizon, etc. That is some spooky magical shit. <a href=\"https://www.threads.net/@tedunderwoodillinois/post/C5gbtaxOdBq\">Ted Underwood put it this way</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>Random accident that the moon and sun are the same apparent size here. If we had interstellar tourism, this is the One Thing that everyone would know about the Earth, and when they visited they wouldn‚Äôt want to see anything else. ‚ÄúWe also have museums?‚Äù we‚Äôd say.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>The moon is slowly drifting away from the Earth and total eclipses will gradually get rarer and rarer until, hundreds of millions of years from now, they will stop completely.<sup><a href=\"#fn:1712846065\">1</a></sup> That we‚Äôre all here right now, getting to experience this magical thing? Like, what?! If a science fiction writer made this up for a story, we‚Äôd say it‚Äôs too much.</p>\n\n<p>And yet, for me at least, the coincidences don‚Äôt stop there.</p>\n\n<p>When I saw <a href=\"https://kottke.org/17/08/my-2017-total-solar-eclipse-trip\">my first total eclipse in 2017</a>, we had to drive for 3.5 hours through three different rainstorms to find some clear skies. When we finally stopped, 40 minutes before totality, it was in a town so small that it‚Äôs not even called a town anymore: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayville,_Missouri\">Rayville, Missouri</a>. Yep, we found the sun in Rayville. What are the odds?</p>\n\n<p>And then this year, on April 8th, the path of totality went right over my house in Vermont. In the past 70 years in Vermont prior to 2024, it‚Äôs been <a href=\"https://www.mynbc5.com/article/cloud-cover-history-in-burlington-on-eclipse-day/46873479\">overcast about 50% of the time</a> and only mostly sunny in 13 of those years. This year? Not a cloud in the sky when I woke up Monday morning.</p>\n\n<p>I watched with a group of people in a big field in Colchester, including my friend Caroline and her dog, Stella (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stella_(given_name)\">a name derived from the Latin word for star</a>). There were a bunch of other groups watching in the field too and after totality had thrilled us all, they trickled back to their cars and homes. Our group stayed and I watched the last little bit of the moon slip past the sun through my telescope ‚Äî it was officially over.</p>\n\n<p>A large nearby group of folks with a couple of dogs left shortly after that. One of the dogs came over for a sniff and one of our party asked the guy what the dog‚Äôs name was. ‚ÄúLuna.‚Äù</p>\n\n<p>And then Luna departed.</p>\n\n<p>Seriously, what are the odds?</p>\n\n<p>Eclipse photo above <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/mouser-nerdbot/53643828976/\">taken by my friend Mouser</a>, with whom I witnessed the 2017 eclipse.
