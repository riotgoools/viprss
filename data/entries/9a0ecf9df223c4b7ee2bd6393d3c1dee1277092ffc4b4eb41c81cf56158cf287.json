{"title":"The Tricycle Haiku Contest","link":"https://kottke.org/24/02/the-tricycle-haiku-contest","date":1708978116000,"content":"\n        <p>In every issue, the quarterly Buddhist magazine Tricycle publishes a winning haiku from its ongoing <a href=\"https://tricycle.org/haiku/\">monthly haiku contest</a>. The poem appears alongside a column written by the contest’s judge, poet and author <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/clarkstrand/\">Clark Strand</a>. This season’s haiku-adjacent column includes the following bit, about one theory on the nature of haiku: </p>\n\n<blockquote><p>The Japanese haiku critic Kenkichi Yamamoto (1907–1988) believed that the best haiku strike a balance between humor and existential isolation. “Loneliness in life and the comical elements of life are two sides of the same coin,” he wrote. As a genre of literature, haiku thrives on the flip of that coin — the small element of uncertainty that challenges our ordinary understanding of the world.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>I hadn’t realized there were such things as haiku critics (!). I also like the idea of loneliness and humor being related somehow. </p>\n\n<p>Read the Spring 2024 winning haiku <a href=\"https://tricycle.org/magazine/strawberry-and-the-vine/\">here</a>.
