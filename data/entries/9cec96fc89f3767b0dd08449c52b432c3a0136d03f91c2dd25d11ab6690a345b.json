Quit! Go for it!”\n</p><p>\nBut instead, they’re surprised at my suggestion:\n</p><p>\nRemember how Tarzan swings through the jungle?\nHe doesn’t let go of the previous vine until the next vine is supporting his weight.\n</p><p>\n<img src=\"/images/tarzan-600x450.gif\" alt=\"Tarzan swinging on vines\" />\n</p><p>\nSo my advice is: Change careers like Tarzan.\n</p><p>\n<strong>\nDon’t let go of the old one until the new one is supporting you.\n</strong>\n</p><p>\n<strong>\nAnd make sure you don’t lose momentum.\n</strong>\n</p><hr /><p>\nP.S.  I highly recommend reading the book “<a href=\"https://sive.rs/book/SoGood\">So Good They Can’t Ignore You</a>” for more thoughts on this.\n</p><p>\nP.P.S.
