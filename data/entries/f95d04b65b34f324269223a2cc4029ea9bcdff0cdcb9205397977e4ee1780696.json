Here's a screen shot.</p>\n<p></p><div><img src=\"https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/06/28/blogrollbrowser.png\" />Screen shot of the Blogroll Browser.</div><p></p>\n<p>You can see it at <a href=\"https://browse.blogroll.social/?blogrollUrl=https%3A%2F%2Ffeedland.social%2Fopml%3Fscreenname%3Ddavewiner%26catname%3Dblogroll&amp;blogrollTitle=davewiner%2Fblogroll\">browser.blogroll.social</a>.</p>\n<p>A caveat -- what you see here is just an experiment. I don't expect this app to be up for any period of time. It's here just to learn from. Part of a bootstrap perhaps.</p>\n<p>PS: Cross-posted on <a href=\"https://dave.micro.blog/2024/06/28/a-blogroll-lab.html\">micro.blog</a>.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"f95d04b65b34f324269223a2cc4029ea9bcdff0cdcb9205397977e4ee1780696","category":"default"}
