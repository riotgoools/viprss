I found out via <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2024/09/16/richard-powers-profile\">this New Yorker profile of Powers</a> by Hua Hsu, which describes the new book like so:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>This month, Powers will publish his fourteenth novel, “Playground,” a book that initially seems like a way for him to add “ocean guy” to his C.V. It essentially comprises three story lines. The first is about Todd Keane, an all-conquering tech giant. The onset of dementia has compelled him to revisit his happiest memories, which involve Rafi Young, a close friend of his teens and twenties from whom he is now estranged. A second story line concerns a close-knit, dwindling community on Makatea, an island in French Polynesia, that must decide how to respond to an offer from wealthy American investors who want to launch a libertarian seasteading enclave nearby. The third follows Evelyne Beaulieu, a famous oceanographer, as she reflects on her life’s work and all the destruction she has witnessed: the collapse of fisheries and the disappearance of various species; the acidification of the seas; the dredging, in a single afternoon, of entire “coral cities that had taken ten thousand years to grow.” There’s also a Silicon Valley-inspired twist, involving Todd’s investments in social networking and artificial intelligence, that brings these narrative threads together.</p>\n\n<p>Powers was a participant in the personal-computing revolution of the seventies and the rise of the Internet in the nineties, and he is deeply attuned to the potential cataclysms that technological innovation could invite. “I had this sense that we were living through this ethical moment again,” he said, of the inspiration for the new book.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>You can <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1324086033/ref=nosim/0sil8\">preorder Playground on Amazon</a> or <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/a/2966/9781324086031\">at Bookshop.org</a>.</p>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/books\">books</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Hua%20Hsu\">Hua Hsu</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Playground\">Playground</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Richard%20Powers\">Richard Powers</a></p>\n\n         <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/09/playground-by-richard-powers\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"6164ebf74605afd161f13dbfc38357528c14e63e6764c0f1d05bb96137e44240","category":"Sites"}
