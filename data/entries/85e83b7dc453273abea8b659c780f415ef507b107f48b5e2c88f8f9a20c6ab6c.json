{"title":"Brats, a Documentary Film About the 80s Hollywood Brat Pack","link":"https://kottke.org/24/06/brats-a-documentary-film-about-the-80s-hollywood-brat-pack","date":1717435342000,"content":"\n        <p></p>\n\n<p>I was a little too young (and culturally sheltered — like I’d never heard of New York magazine) in 1985 to really understand what the heck the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brat_Pack\">Brat Pack</a> was (not to mention <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat_Pack\">what the name was referencing</a>), but as a child of the 80s, I obviously grew up watching movies and TV shows that featured these actors. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brat_Pack\">According to Wikipedia</a> (which is a good read if you’re unfamiliar with the whole thing), here are some of the actors that were in the Brat Pack (or Brat Pack-adjacent): Emilio Estevez, Anthony Michael Hall, Rob Lowe, Andrew McCarthy, Demi Moore, Judd Nelson, Molly Ringwald, Ally Sheedy, Tom Cruise, Charlie Sheen, James Spader, Robert Downey Jr., John Cusack, and Matthew Broderick.</p>\n\n<p>The Brat Pack moniker was coined in <a href=\"https://nymag.com/movies/features/49902/\">a 1985 New York magazine article</a> and it stuck. And according to some of the members, it ruined lives, careers, and friendships. Now one of the group members, Andrew McCarthy, has directed a documentary about the group: Brats. <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2024/05/brat-pack-documentary-brats-sets-premiere-date-hulu-1235914607/\">From Deadline</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>Brats looks at the iconic films of the 1980s that shaped a generation and the narrative that took hold when their young stars were branded the “Brat Pack.” McCarthy reunites with his fellow Brat Packers — friends, colleagues and former foes, including Rob Lowe, Demi Moore, Ally Sheedy, Emilio Estevez, Jon Cryer, Lea Thompson and Timothy Hutton, many of whom he had not seen for over 30 years — to answer the question: What did it mean to be part of the Brat Pack? The actor-filmmaker also sits down for a first-time conversation with writer David Blum, who fatefully coined the term Brat Pack in a 1985 New York Magazine cover story.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>That trailer definitely hooked me in. Brats will be available on Hulu on June 13.</p>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Andrew%20McCarthy\">Andrew McCarthy</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Brats\">Brats</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Hollywood\">Hollywood</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/movies\">movies</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/trailers\">trailers</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/video\">video</a></p>\n\n         <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/06/brats-a-documentary-film-about-the-80s-hollywood-brat-pack\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Jason Kottke","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"85e83b7dc453273abea8b659c780f415ef507b107f48b5e2c88f8f9a20c6ab6c","category":"default"}
