I was thinking of the <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/4456879-special-counsel-describes-biden-as-elderly-man-with-a-poor-memory-in-eye-raising-report/\">story</a> about the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_K._Hur\">special prosecutor</a> who did something highly unethical in writing a public, official, condemnation of someone he investigated yet decided not to prosecute. We have judges and juries for that. Only in a police state can a prosecutor pass judgment on an accused person. The news orgs took the bait, I didn't read one report on who <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=Robert+K.+Hur\">Robert K. Hur</a> is, and the ethics of what he did. Is it appropriate to quote a person who was behaving so openly unethically, esp if you don't disclaim that up front. It's not that democracy is on the ballot this year, we're already over the line. Our journalism is acting as if it were already controlled by the authoritarians. Our lack of trust in journalism is our biggest problem. How can we force journalism to start to be a <i>little</i> accountable. Right now they're the only part of our ruling class that can't have their choices reviewed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"387c4ef767b7172d14a0f4c77fd83235d53c7f60451dbd9eeb323ab5f0c94d52","category":"default"}
