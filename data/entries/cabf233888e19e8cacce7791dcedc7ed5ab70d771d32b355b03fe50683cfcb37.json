Far better. For example, I signed up for a trial subscription to BritBox on Amazon Prime, and decided I didn't want to continue. Amazon is famous for having terrible docs, in every part of the system. They made it basically impossible for me to quickly find the place where you unsubscribe. Okay so I asked ChatGPT and it knew how to do it, and I was unsubscribed in a few seconds. This feature pays for the whole $20 per month, everything else is a bonus. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/06/30/closeYourEyesAndIllKissYou.png\" />Another example. Something was screwed up in Caddy, a wonderful product, makes it super easy to support HTTPS. But the docs were written by programmers, and thus lack a user's perspective. Pretty common thing, and hard to avoid. So I asked ChatGPT questions to help me dig into the problem. It's annoyingly overly verbose, it answers questions I didn't ask, and thus wastes time, but -- in about ten minutes it put something on a checklist which turned out to be the problem. It's hard to debug a system problem you weren't expecting to have. The robot doesn't need to have its memory refreshed, unlike my 69-year-old human brain. </p>\n<p>When I write these little vignettes I hope to counter the hype you hear out there, because ChatGPT is an amazingly useful breakthrough product in every way. I'm always finding new incredible uses for it. Products like that come along at most every twenty years or so. I've created some good software in my life, but nothing like this. This is like the Beatles, or the web. It's that difference-making. </p>","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"cabf233888e19e8cacce7791dcedc7ed5ab70d771d32b355b03fe50683cfcb37","category":"default"}
