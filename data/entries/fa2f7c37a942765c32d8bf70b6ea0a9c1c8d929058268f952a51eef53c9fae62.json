They do. But there are two caveats.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It <a href=\"https://rss.app/pricing\">costs</a> $9.99 per month for 15 feeds. Could be a bit expensive for some people's budgets.</li>\n<li><img src=\"http://scripting.com/images/2023/07/02/validRss.png\" />The second concern is more serious. It doesn't handle titleless items properly. It repeats the contents of the tweet in the title and description of the feeds it generates. An <a href=\"https://feeder.scripting.com/returnjson?feedurl=https://rss.app/feeds/3A2qGRnWMHFk5DvE.xml\">example</a>. This is not right, and it's not the way Mastodon and Bluesky do it. There's nothing wrong with items that have no titles. When an item has no title you do the common sense thing -- omit the title. I'm happy to help with this. I wrote the <a href=\"https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html\">RSS 2.0 spec</a>, and am something of an authority on this. It's important to get this right.</li>\n</ol>","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"fa2f7c37a942765c32d8bf70b6ea0a9c1c8d929058268f952a51eef53c9fae62","category":"Sites"}
