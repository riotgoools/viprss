And although <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/02/0043979-i-am-a-relative-nyt#cmt-2609\">like Jason</a> I’m a little put off by how negative the reviews can be — I don’t want the thing I’m so proud to have just finished be considered “<a href=\"https://rexwordpuzzle.blogspot.com/2024/02/game-island-represented-by-hexagonal.html\">toothless</a>” or “<a href=\"https://rexwordpuzzle.blogspot.com/2024/02/old-coin-in-france-mon-2-26-24-greeting.html\">dead in the water</a>”!! — they’re also funny. So maybe it’s fine, or actually better. For instance, from <a href=\"https://rexwordpuzzle.blogspot.com/2024/02/spanish-sparkling-wine-wed-2-28-24.html\">his review of Tuesday’s puzzle</a>: </p>\n\n<blockquote><p>The [theme answers] seemed listless (except [REDACTED], which just seemed bizarre), and the overall fill ran weak (and heavily, drearily name-y; more on that below), and then [REDACTED], ugh, I would’ve shut my computer right there if I weren’t contractually obligated to go on. […] As for the rest of the puzzle, it was gunked up with names to an unusual, and possibly dangerous degree.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Lol. Meanwhile, there’s also <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/\">XWordInfo</a> (NY Times crossword “answers and insights” — useful for puzzle constructors, too), <a href=\"https://crosswordfiend.com/\">Diary of a Crossword Fiend</a> (“reviewing the best crosswords in print and on the web”), and <a href=\"https://dailycrosswordlinks.com/\">Daily Crossword Links</a> (“all the day’s crosswords in one place”), as well as the NY Times’ own <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/daily-crossword-column\">Daily Wordplay Column</a>, an adjoining column riffing on each day’s puzzle, often with a mini-interview of that day’s puzzle constructor. (From today’s constructor: “This puzzle was partly inspired by my children, who love to put on one red oven mitt and run around the kitchen exclaiming, ‘Look, I’m an (18A)!’”) The comments section here is also a goldmine for community-minded puzzlers.  What else is out there?</p>\n\n<p>But really the main thing to do after finishing the puzzle is to open the Spelling Bee back up… Am I right???</p>\n\n <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/crossword%20puzzles\">crossword puzzles</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/games\">games</a></p>\n\n <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/02/what-to-do-after-you-finish-the-ny-times-crossword-puzzle\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Edith Zimmerman","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"aefb513f55958112b924f4d412d113555e0093eeac1bdabab83ed933ad92de69","category":"default"}
