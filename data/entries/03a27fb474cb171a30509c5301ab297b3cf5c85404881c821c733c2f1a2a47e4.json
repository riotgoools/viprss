We need an analogous rule that says there should be no reporting on polls until after the polls are closed, to allow the people to form their own opinions, for the same reason. People are less likely to vote if they feel the outcome is a foregone conclusion. They even factor this into their polling. For example, in 2016, a lot of people stayed home in swing states when they a solid win for Hillary Clinton was projected by polls.","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"03a27fb474cb171a30509c5301ab297b3cf5c85404881c821c733c2f1a2a47e4","category":"default"}
