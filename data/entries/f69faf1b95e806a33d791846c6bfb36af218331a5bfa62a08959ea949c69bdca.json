(╥_╥)) in that zone. and for a myriad of other and more important reasons, i hope it doesn't even get to that point where it happens again.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"elle's homepage","siteHash":"dd208d4e2120a26882546f1ff773220630fa4cf22a80af7c01f94b10c97a05f1","entryHash":"f69faf1b95e806a33d791846c6bfb36af218331a5bfa62a08959ea949c69bdca","category":"Sites"}
