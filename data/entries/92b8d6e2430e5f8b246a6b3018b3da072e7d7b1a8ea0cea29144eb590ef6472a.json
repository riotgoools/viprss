My favorite part is the intro, though, where he talks about his own process (“that was the beginning of my torment”).</p>\n\n<p>I’m hoping the answer to the “persevere or surrender” question is in there very explicitly, by the way!</p>\n\n <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Adam%20Moss\">Adam Moss</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/books\">books</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Cheryl%20Pope\">Cheryl Pope</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/creative%20processes\">creative processes</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Kara%20Walker\">Kara Walker</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Louise%20Gl%C3%BCck\">Louise Glück</a></p>\n\n <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/04/adam-moss-and-the-creative-process\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Edith Zimmerman","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"92b8d6e2430e5f8b246a6b3018b3da072e7d7b1a8ea0cea29144eb590ef6472a","category":"default"}
