If I wanted my calculator to give me incorrect results I could press the wrong keys. In other words, ChatGPT is a very new tool.

But the result, if you pay attention and don't drive it under the wheels of a bus, is that you can do things you never could do before.","author":"","siteTitle":"Scripting News","siteHash":"d6ad59631287cc248e52fdfe0c4f962c0fd08643d455b40f799700d8b2f97c65","entryHash":"2e1122085b92c2d638ee186bdafb22bac6669993723d2b5b8d0ac7610f9232bf","category":"default"}
