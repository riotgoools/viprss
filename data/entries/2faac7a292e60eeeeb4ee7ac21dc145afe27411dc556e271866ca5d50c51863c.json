{"title":"Brutal Lyon 25 Stair, Destroyer of Action Sport Dreams","link":"https://kottke.org/24/03/brutal-lyon-25-stair-destroyer-of-action-sport-dreams","date":1711508831000,"content":"\n        <p>I love Australian pro skater Ricky Glaser’s narration of all the videos he could find of people attempting to jump a famous set of 25 stairs in Lyon. Aaron “Jaws” Homoki (no relation), <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T32jnYbCaP0\">was the first to do it</a> despite injuring himself on the stairs previously. At 6:15 the scooter carnage starts, “Like is he alive after that?” We can also appreciate Glaser’s criticism of the camera work at about 9:50. This is truly a masterpiece.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>By the way, you may have heard of Ricky Glaser, as he is the world record holder for most kick flips in a minute, 36, which is just about 3 per second if my math is right. </p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Aaron%20Homoki\">Aaron Homoki</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/bicycles\">bicycles</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Ricky%20Glaser\">Ricky Glaser</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/skating\">skating</a></p>\n\n <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/03/brutal-lyon-25-stair-destroyer-of-action-sport-dreams\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>\n\n    ","author":"Aaron Cohen","siteTitle":"Kottke","siteHash":"89a883271b4598f9b33ebe87be70d38557bcd266e68aee521a8f93622e0ab723","entryHash":"2faac7a292e60eeeeb4ee7ac21dc145afe27411dc556e271866ca5d50c51863c","category":"default"}
