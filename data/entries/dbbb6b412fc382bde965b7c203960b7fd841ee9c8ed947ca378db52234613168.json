A ghost is a palpable presence of an absence charged with feeling, the contour of something half-known, half-remembered, half-forgotten — a halfway house between what we understand and what we cannot, between what we have let go and what we cannot. </p>\n<p>Children are especially prone to perceiving ghosts because childhood itself is such a halfway house between imagination and reality, because what they know is so small against the vastness of what there is yet to know and what may never be known that they invent their own answers to the immense open question of life, answers wild and wondrous and often true. </p>\n<p>Writer Kyo Maclear and artist Katty Maurey conjure up this primal reckoning with the unknowns of love and loss in <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Theres-Ghost-Garden-Kyo-Maclear/dp/1592704050/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>There’s a Ghost in the Garden</em></strong></a> (<a

garden. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Theres-Ghost-Garden-Kyo-Maclear/dp/1592704050/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\"

the ghostly presence — a ghost mischievous but friendly, knocking down flower pots, leaving “little presents” in the bird nest and tracks on the path that “was once a cool, dark stream” — the boy discovers that his grandfather also had a childhood, that inside the old man lives the ghost of a long-ago boy who also had fantasies and fears, who also used to play in the flickering sunlight, who once swam in the stream that is now a dry path. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Theres-Ghost-Garden-Kyo-Maclear/dp/1592704050/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\"
